either
    a. get rid of ListenerIntersection
    b. rework how ListenerIntersection works, more like a ListenerRegistry
add meme functionality; just put the entirety of my meme folder in the bot, see how that goes
add neco-arc functionality; the mental illness better go crazy
add moderator functionality using the PermissionChecker class (that i probably got off of someone, this looks like code way too good for such a young me)

make it where when there's a change in the state of the minecraft server OsakaBot makes that known to the people. that is hte main functionality of hte bot.
