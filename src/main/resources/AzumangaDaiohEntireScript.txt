01-5. The Osakan gal
Yukari:
Well class, it seems we're getting a fresh new transfer student (in) today.

Students:
Huh?

Yukari:
This new addition to our force hails from Osaka.
And it was no small trick getting her.

Tomo:
An Osakan gal, huh?
All I can think of is....

Narration:
Hey, you make any money?
It's coming along.

Tomo:
She'll be my new archrival!
I bet she's a girl equipped with all kinds of incredible comebacks!
Yomi, take a dig at me! Say: "Why in the heck?"

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
Come on!

Yomi:
Why in the heck?

Tomo:
Argh! Argh! Argh!

Tomo:
Okay so, think I should do that once she takes a stab at me?

Yomi:
Why the heck would you?


Yukari:
Well then, now that we've straightened all our desks,
allow me to introduce you to your new classmate.
Miss Kasuga.

Yukari:
Hi there.
Tell us about yourself.

Osaka:
Yes ma'am.
I'm Ayumu Kasuga.
And I come from Osaka.
It's pleasure to meet all of you.

Yukari:
No, no, no, no.
It's very sweet of you to be so considerate and try to speak like we do.
But you can just say, "Darn pleased ta meetcha! "

Osaka:
But, but even in Osaka... I...

Yukari:
Go on!

Osaka:
Um... darn pleased ta meetcha, um, y'all.


Chihiro:
Hey, tell me if this is true or not:
do people in Osaka cross the street even when the light's red?

Osaka:
I don't know, I mean, I don't.
I don't like crowded places much.

Yomi:
I have to say, you don't really seem like the typical Osakan, Kasuga.
I was expecting someone a little more rowdy than you.

Osaka:
Well, it's not like all us Osaka folk are rowdy, you know.

Tomo:
Aha, Imposter!

Osaka:
Imposter? I'm an imposter?
You say I'm a fake but...

Tomo:
Okay, then show me your lunch box.
As they say, the proof is in the pudding, or in the case of the true Osakan, and the fried octopus balls they always pack.

Osaka:
Um, but the thing is .. just 'cause I'm from Osaka...

Tomo:
What?

Osaka:
Huh. Hey, why in the heck?

Tomo:
All right!


Yukari:
I was too busy to complete the work.

Osaka:
People back in Osaka used to tell me all the time how spaced out I was.
But I really ought to take this transfer as a chance to get it together once and for all.
Get it together.
Get it together.
Get it together.

Yukari:
Miss Kasuga.

Osaka:
Get it together.
Get it together.

Yukari:
Miss Kasuga.

Osaka:
Uh?

Yukari:
Miss Kasuga.
Were you listening?

Osaka:
Uh, no.

Yukari:
Come on!
Get it together, will ya?
Okay, Mr. Ohyama.

Ohyama:
Yes, ma'am.

Osaka:
Get it together.
Get it together.
Get it together.

Yukari:
Oh, the bell already?
All right.
Teacher's done for the day.
Well, adios!

Osaka:
It's finally over.
I'll get it together tomorrow.
Get it together.
Get it together.

Tomo:
Osaka! Osaka!

Osaka:
Hm?

Tomo:
Hey, Osaka.
Japanese Pizza meals, do they really exist?

Osaka:
Um, Osaka?

Tomo:
Oh, yeah.
Kansai people are totally wack.
Eating a full bowl of rice with a Japanese Pizza.
Do you do that, too, Osaka?

Osaka:
Osaka?
Do you mean me?

Tomo:
Yeah, it's like your new nickname.
Osaka, 'cause you're from Osaka.
Get it?

Osaka:
Huh?
Wait! You mean just like that?

Tomo:
Did everybody hear me?
Miss Kasuga is now Osaka.

Osaka:
Say what?

Yomi:
Okay, Sure thing.

Kaorin:
Okay.

Chiyo:
All right. I understand you.

Chihiro:
Yep, that's a roger.

Tomo:
All right.
Then it's set.
You're officially Osaka.
So welcome to class three, classmate.

Osaka:
And just like that, before I knew it, I was nicknamed Osaka.
Wah.


-- Preview --

Osaka:
Azumanga Daioh. That's Great King Azumanga, right?

Yomi:
Where'd that come from?

Osaka:
So, where's Prince Azumanga?

Tomo:
The prince is the king's kid, so it's gotta be whichever shows airing before us.

Yomi:
No, it's the one after.
Ever hear of succession?

Chiyo:
I think it's kinda weird to be calling it Great King in the first place.

Osaka:
I got it. The culprit is with us right here.

Yomi:
What do you mean, culprit?

Osaka:
This preview is Prince Azumanga!

Everyone:
Oh.

02-1. Osaka Today as well

Osaka:
I am Ayumu Kasuga.
I just transferred here from Osaka the other day.
Tokyo folks do the right thing and stop when the light's red.
Osaka folks keep crossing no matter what.
So it can get pretty ugly.
Ah, I better cross, too.
Shoot, the light changed.
School here isn't much different from school in Osaka.

Osaka:
Uh?

Chiyo:
Here.

Osaka:
Uh, what's a little kid like her doing in here?

Yomi:
Oh, her?
That's Chiyo-chan.
The child prodigy.

Osaka:
The child prodigy?

Yomi:
She may be only ten years old.
But she's attending high school because she's super smart.

Osaka:
Wow.
Oh, I know.
There was this little boy Shouta from my neighborhood that people said like to smart [awful/off a] lot.
She must be the extreme version of that.

Yomi:
I think you may be slightly off the mark there.


Osaka:
Back when I lived in Osaka, people used to say I was slow or spacey.
Sometimes I wonder about it myself, thinking, am I really that spacey?

Osaka:
Ah!
Oh, now my handkerchief's soaking wet.

Osaka:
Hm?

Kaorin:
Osaka, what are you doing?

Osaka:
You know those tiny bubbles inside your eyes you sometimes catch?
Yeah, I'm tracking them down as we speak.

Kaorin:
I see... good luck with that.

Osaka:
Yeah, thank you.


Yukari:
So here we have the ....

Student:
Ah!

Yukari:
Huh?

Student:
Whoa! It's a huge cockroach!

Student:
It went that way!

Chihiro:
I hate cockroaches!

Yukari:
Oh, come on!
Someone catch the damn bug, will ya?

Tomo:
All right! Just leave it to me!
Ah! Ah!

Tomo:
Frigging bug!
That little sucker's pretty damn quick!

Chiyo:
What in the world are you aiming at?

Yomi:
You're doing this on purpose, aren't you?

Tomo:
Hold it right there.

Tomo:
Where are you going?
Ahhhhhhh!

Tomo:
Bull's eye!

Student:
Yeah!

Student:
Hey, come to think of it, who was it that let out the first scream anyway.

Student:
Beats me.
Good question though.

Yukari:
Okay, okay.
Let's all settle down and get back to the lesson.

Tomo:
Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
Tomo, what's the matter?

Tomo:
It's about my textbook.
I used it to smash the cockroach.
What should I do with this?

Yukari:
Argh!
Get back!

Yukari:
D-don't come any closer!

Tomo:
Miss Yukari?!

Yukari:
Get it away! Blah!
02-2. P.E. - Volleyball
Osaka:
Back in Osaka,
I was always the slowest runner in my class.
But this class has a grade school kid in it.

Nyamo:
Okay, get ready!
On your mark.
Get set. Go!

Osaka:
I won't lose. I can't lose.
Chiyo-chan, she might be a prodigy.
But I can't lose.
There's just no way!

Osaka:
I lost.
Am... Am I not smart enough?
I guess, maybe, I guess I'm just no match for a prodigy?

Yomi:
In all the races with Chiyo-chan, you're the first one who's ever lost.

Nyamo:
For today's P.E. class, we'll be playing volleyball.
So let's get into groups of six, okay?

Yomi:
Groups of six?
So, this is our winning combination?

Tomo:
All right!
Aiming for the ten million in prizes.
Watch out, Wimbledon.
Here we come!

Osaka:
Yeah!

Yomi:
There's no such thing for P.E.
Would you two get a grip?

Chihiro:
Zero - zero.

Chiyo:
Hm!

Yomi:
Nice Chiyo-chan!
Heads up!

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, that was really amazing!
Aha!

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki is simply too awesome for words.

Osaka:
That girl there? The one you called Miss Sakaki?
She seems pretty cool.

Kaorin:
Isn't she, though?
No one's cooler.

Osaka:
Hm. That's it.
From now on, she'll be what I'm aiming for.

Kaorin:
What? Aiming for her?
Now, wait just a minute!

Osaka:
And one day, I'll reach that goal that I was aiming for her and I'll be just as cool as she is.

Kaorin:
Oh, so that's what you meant when you said 'aim'.
Huh. good luck, then.
'Cause you are so gonna need some.


Tomo:
Hey, Losers! Eat this!

Chiyo:
Ah!

Tomo:
Oh, sorry, sorry!

Chiyo:
My head hurts, it hurts a lot.

Tomo:
Don't worry, you're okay.

Yomi:
That's not for you to say!

Nyamo:
Playing a match right off the bat seems a little too dangerous.
So let's everyone pair off and work on the overhead passing.

Osaka:
Hey, Chiyo-chan.
You wanna be my partner?

Chiyo:
Okay.

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, here I go!

Chiyo:
Okay, I'm ready when you are!

Osaka:
Okay, here it comes!

Chiyo:
All right, all right, all right, all right, um!

Osaka:
Don't sweat it, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Okay!

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, get ready for it!
And there!

Osaka:
Uh, uh, uh, aw!

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, are you all right?

Osaka:
I'm okay!

Osaka:
'Kay, here we go again!
Ha!

Chiyo:
Uh, uh, uh, aw!

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, you're okay?

Chiyo:
Yeah, yeah!

Chiyo:
All right, here goes again!
Ah!

Osaka:
Uh, uh, uh, aw!

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, I'm sorry!

Osaka:
That's okay!

Osaka:
Heads up!

Chiyo:
Right!

Chiyo:
Here, ready!

Osaka:
Here goes nothing!

Chiyo:
I'm ready.

Osaka:
There you go!
02-3. Hiccups
Yomi:
Are you all right?
You look rather precarious.
Hey, watch it!

Osaka:
Made it back safe and sound.

Yomi:
Made it back? Back from where?

Tomo:
All right I guess it's time for me to dig in.
Tada!
Oh, wow! Fried chicken, omelet, and meat balls!
Woohoo! Tomo's all-time favorites on one plate.
Rub-a-dub-dub, thanks for the grub.

Chiyo:
Huh? What's wrong, Miss Osaka?

Osaka:
Please don't talk to me right now.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Hey, Yomi.

Yomi:
So, what about it?

Osaka:
Tomo, Tomo, look!

Tomo:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Is she happy just 'cause she split it so clean?

Tomo:
Hey, Yomi!

Yomi:
Hm?

Tomo:
What the heck is up with that croquette? It's all red inside.

Yomi:
What? You mean this?
It's a super red hot chili pepper croquette.

Tomo:
Oh yeah, you like your food crazy hot, don't you?

Chiyo:
It looks really spicy.

Tomo:
Hey Osaka, you like spicy food?

Osaka:
No way, I'm terrible with that kind of stuff.

Yomi:
Hm... hey!
Why don't you give this a little try?

Osaka:
Come on!
I just told you I'm no good with that kind of stuff.
You really ought to listen when someone tells you something.

Yomi:
Hey, not to worry.
It's also got a lot of cayenne pepper in it.

Osaka:
And what's cayenne?

Yomi:
I guess you could say it's like shark fins or swallow's nests, y'know, one of those rare exotic dishes.

Osaka:
Oh, then I guess I'll have a taste of it.

Chiyo:
Oh, no, wait!

Osaka:
Hm. Urgh!

Osaka:
You're awful.
I thought I was gonna die.

Yomi:
Oh, sorry about that.

Osaka:
Hic....
What the...

Yomi:
What's this now?
You got hiccups?

Chiyo:
Oh! I bet it's because you ate that spicy stuff.

Osaka:
Is that how it works?
Then what do I do?

Tomo:
Hey, can't you cure it by drinking water?

Osaka:
Water?

Osaka:
Would it be okay if I drink juice?

Tomo:
I don't think it matters.
Hey, carbonated drinks might work even better.

Osaka:
Uh-uh, no way, I'm not real good with carbonation.

Tomo:
What? For real?

Tomo:
Those're some stubborn hiccups.

Chiyo:
I heard it's good if you take a drink while you pinch your nose.

Yomi:
Really?
Because I seem to remember we should have to keep both of your ears plugged up.

Tomo:
All right, let's try them both together.

Osaka:
What?

Tomo:
Okay, you ready?

Osaka:
Yeah.

Tomo:
Come on! Go for it!
Well then, are you cured?

Osaka:
Um... Can't say for sure.

Yomi:
No, she isn't cured.

Tomo:
Oh, wait, I know!

Tomo:
I heard that drinking from a cup balanced on chopsticks is supposed to work.

Yomi:
You sure about that?

Osaka:
Aaah.

Yomi:
Next hour's music, right?
We better hurry up.

Tomo:
Yeah, yeah.

Chiyo:
Hey, wait up!

02-4. The Brain
Yukari:
Will you knock it off, Osaka!

Tomo:
Hey, time to go home!
Huh? They still haven't gone away yet?

Yomi:
That means it's been going on for over two hours now.

Tomo:
That reminds me, I think I heard you can die if you keep hiccupping for a whole day.

Everybody:
No way!

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, please be afraid!
Please be very very afraid!

Osaka
Sorry, but that ain't scaring me one little bit.

Tomo:
Oh, yeah.
I just remembered!

Osaka:
Huh?

Tomo:
Haaaa yah!

Osaka:
Ow!

Tomo:
You can cure hiccups by smacking the person on the back!

Chiyo:
Isn't that the way you do when you get something stuck in your throat?

Tomo:
Huh? Sorry about that.

Osaka:
That, that was mean.

Yomi:
From what I seem to recall, hiccupps happen because something is convulsing.

Chiyo:
Yeah. That's it, spasms in the diaphragm.

Osaka:
Where's the diaphragm?

Chiyo:
It's right underneath your lungs.

Tomo:
Right here!

Osaka:
Ow!

Chiyo:
Hey, th-that's the solar plexus!

Yomi:
A vital point on the human body.

Tomo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Are you cured?
No good, huh?

Sakaki:
You can cure hiccups by brewing persimmon sepals and drinking the tea.

Tomo:
Persimmon?

Yomi:
You know that's some kind of folk remedy, right?

Osaka:
But we ain't got any persimmons with us.

Sakaki:
Then, try holding your breath for a while.

Chiyo:
Ready? OK, start!

Osaka:
Haa!

Tomo:
Man, that didn't take long at all.

Sakaki:
Now, apply pressure to the eyeballs.

Osaka:
Ow, ow, ow...

Sakaki:
Okay now, pull on the tongue.

Yomi:
It isn't going away.

Chiyo:
So do you have any other ideas?

Sakaki:
Let me think.
Give it to someone else.

Yomi:
This is all starting to sound a bit hokey.

Osaka:
Give it to someone else...

Yomi:
Huh? Just what are you looking at?

Yomi:
If it's still not getting any better, it could be that you're really sick.

Sakaki:
Maybe you should go and have it checked out.

Tomo:
You think she's sick?
But, of what?

Sakaki:
Like the brain.

Osaka:
The brain?

Yomi,Tomo:
Oh!

Osaka:
Hang on a second!
What are you talking about?

Yomi:
Well, eh, it's because your brain...
I think it might have a few problems.

Osaka:
Problems? What?

Tomo:
Well, y'are kind of weird sometimes.

Osaka:
You're talking about symptoms?

Tomo:
Not really symptoms, but you know?

Yomi:
Uh-huh.
The fact that she is not aware of the symptoms is sort of the symptom itself.

Osaka:
What's that supposed to mean?
I don't get it.

Chiyo:
Excuse me, but it seems your hiccups stopped now.

Osaka:
Wow, I guess you're right.
I must be cured.
It's happily ever after.

Chiyo:
Yeah, thank goodness for that.
But I wonder what it was that stopped them.

Yomi:
Hm, something worked?
But what?

Chiyo:
Uh-oh.

Osaka:
Oh, that's it, I gave it to Chiyo-chan.

Yomi:
Is that even possible?

Tomo:
Okay, let's do everything we tried on Osaka from the very start.

Osaka:
That sounds good.
What came first though?

Chiyo:
Hey!

Yomi:
Smack on the back and then hit her solar plexus.

Tomo:
Oh, right, right.

Chiyo:
This can't be!

02-5. Brand New
Osaka:
Sharks are fish, aren't they?
And dolphins are mammals, right?
So that being the case, would that make snails ought to be bugs?

Yomi:
What? Hm.
I'm not entirely sure I understand how you came up with "that being the case."
But I don't think snails are classified as bugs.

Osaka:
Oh,

Yomi:
But, the truth is I'm really not sure.

Osaka:
I figured I had it right.

Yomi:
What?

Osaka:
After all, it'd be pretty weird if a snail got mixed up in somebody's insect collection.

Yomi:
I don't think that's quite the issue here.

Osaka:
I bring you grains of truth!
Hey Tomo, listen up!

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Did you know rice is the most popular grain in the world?

Tomo:
Wow.

Osaka:
You're no good, Tomo.

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
I bring you grains of truth!
Get this, Yomi!

Yomi:
Huh?

Osaka:
Rice is the most popular grain in the world.

Yomi:
Really.

Osaka:
You got it all wrong.

Yomi:
Huh?

Osaka:
No, no, see.
What you were supposed to say was "that ain't no grains of truth, that's the truth about grain."

Yomi:
Oh, sorry.

Osaka:
I'm in the middle of class right now.
But I thought about a lot of things today.

Here's contemplation #1.
Chiyo-chan's pigtails have a direct connection with one another
We should experiment right away.
Oh wow! There really is a connection between 'em.

Here's contemplation #2.
This new discovery could very well mean that, maybe...
Ha!
Just as I suspected, her pigtails are detachable after all.

Here's contemplation #3.
Given the above, something like this could happen.

Chiyo:
Look, Miss Osaka.
Check out the great present I got for Christmas this year!

Osaka:
Oh, wow! So what is it?

Chiyo:
Go on!
You can take a look yourself.

Osaka:
Okay, what are they?

Chiyo:
Here, why don't I show you...?
Ah-ha.

Chiyo:
See, it's a brand new pair for me.
Ha-ha-ha-ha.

Yukari:
Osaka.
Hey, Osaka!

Osaka:
Huh?
Oh, hi, Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
Listen, I'm working here so don't you dare fall asleep!

Osaka:
Yes, ma'am.

Osaka:
I fell asleep without even realizin' it.
Must be 'cause I've been thinkin' 'bout all this stuff.
I think I better go to bed early today.
Huuuhh.

Yukari:
Hey! Don't fall asleep!


-- Preview --

Yukari:
Now is the time to settle this once and for all!
We'll fight it out to see who's better, a language teacher or a P.E. teacher.

Nyamo:
Better? A teacher is a teacher, we're both the same.

Yukari:
Ha, you're so wrong.
A language teacher got real good grammar...

Nyamo:
And a P.E. teacher is good at sports.

Yukari:
Oh, yeah?! Is that why you can't find a boyfriend?!

Nyamo:
That has nothing to do with this!
Besides, it's not like you're...

Yukari:
Hey, everyone!
We have you look forward to Azumanga Daioh next time too!

Nyamo:
Don't change the subject!

03-1. Nyamo
Chiyo:
Hi! Excuse me.
Did you want something, Miss Kurosawa?

Nyamo:
Oh, Chiyo-chan.
I'm sorry but I had to call you in today.
I just received this in the mail.
Here, your swimsuit.

Chiyo:
Ah, thank you very much.

Nyamo:
Now I can special order swimsuits,
but not the pool, which will be deeper than you're used to.
I want you to be extra careful, okay?

Chiyo:
I will.

Yukari:
Nyamo!
What do you say we go drinking after school is let out today.
Right now, the bar Yotchan in front of the train station is having a major special on those draft beers you like so much.
And two-for-one you call it 'cause it's ladies' night.

Nyamo:
I'm trying to have a serious conversation here so I'd appreciate it if you quit bugging me.

Yukari:
You shouldn't be so serious, Nyamo.
It's bad for your health.

Nyamo:
Oh, shut up!

Chiyo:
Excuse me.
What exactly is Nyomo?

Yukari:
Oh, it's short for Minamo.
It was a nickname from our school days.

Chiyo:
Oh.

Nyamo:
I told you, stop using that nickname at school.

Yukari:
Come on! Who cares, huh?

Nyamo:
What you do with your stuff in private is one thing,
but you should tidy up when you're at school
I mean, can't you do something about your desk?

Yukari:
Look, "Mom", all this stuff here is organized in its own special way.
I know perfectly well where everything is.

Nyamo:
Okay, then give me back the dictionary I lent you.

Yukari:
All right, sorry.
Let's see. Dictionary, dictionary.
Right here, huh?

Chiyo:
Watch out!

Yukari, Nyamo:
Whoa.

Chiyo:
Don't just sit there watching! Help!
Ah!

Nyamo:
Chiyo-chan!
Are you okay?

Chiyo:
Miss Yukari, please say you'll clean up, please tidy up!

Yukari:
Yeah, yeah, I know.

Chiyo:
Ah!

Yukari:
Chiyo-chan!

Osaka:
Wow.
You're saying Miss Kurosawa and Miss Yukari both went to high school together?

Chiyo:
That's right.
Not only that, they are alumni at this very school.

Tomo:
If we're taking about being in school together, we outrank them easy.

Osaka:
What do you mean "outrank"?

Tomo:
See, the truth of the matter is Yomi and I have been together since I started grade school.

Chiyo:
Wow, that's really incredible, Tomo.
I don't have anyone that's been with me since I was in grade school.

Yomi:
Yeah, I bet you don't.

Tomo:
Uh-huh.

Tomo:
So, I know lots of secrets about Yomi that you guys don't.
All kinds of good stuff.
Things like ...

Yomi:
Hold it!
Just what are you gonna say?

Tomo:
The terror of the moldy bread.

Osaka:
Moldy?

Chiyo:
Bread?

Tomo:
Back in our grade school days, Yomi left some bread in her desk overnight and it grew moldy and developed into something terrible!
On top of that, the mold grew cognizant and our troubles thus began!
There we were holed up in the science preparation room.
But with a single alcohol lamp, we held the swarm of mold at bay!

Osaka:
Whoa.

Yomi:
Chiyo-chan, let's go.

Tomo:
That's when I had a brilliant flash of inspiration!
If we got the mold remover from the bathroom, then we'd be able to defeat them.

Osaka:
Oh.

Osaka:
Oh, I see.
The story 'bout the mold aliens was all made up!

Yomi:
Why would you think it was real?

Osaka:
There was a real sense of reality to it.

Tomo:
Of course there was.
It was based on a true story.

Yomi:
No, it was not!

Chiyo:
Oh, it's Miss Kurosawa.

Tomo:
Yo, Miss Kurosawa.

Nyamo:
What is it?

Tomo:
Hey, we just heard you and Yukari were classmates back when you two were in high school?

Nyamo:
Mm-hm, we were.

Osaka:
Can you tell us what kind of student Miss Yukari was back then?

Nyamo:
Let's see, there's a lot of stories for me to choose from.

Yukari:
Love letter! Love letter, la-la-lovey, lovey letter, love letter! Love letter, lovey-dovey-dovey-dovey-dovey love letter! La-la-la-la-la-la-la, love letter, love letter......

Nyamo:
Hmmmmm!
But most of them are pretty boring.
N-Not much to say...
Hmmmmm!

Yomi:
Whoa, Yukari must have something on her.


03-2. Factional Rivalry
Student1:
Hey, who do you think is the cooler teacher?
Miss Kurosawa or Miss Yukari?

Student2:
Come on, that's a no-brainer.
Miss Yukari, of course.

Student1:
Hahahaha!
What are you, a comedian or something?
Kurosawa is way more...
Aw!

Yukari:
Hahahaha!

Student3:
I have an idea: why don't you talk to Miss Kurosawa and she tells you?

Student4:
Yeah, I think I will.
Miss Kurosawa just might understand.

Yukari:
Anyone over here need a teacher that you can easily talk to?
Come on! Don't be shy!

Yukari:
I swear, that Nyamo.
What is it that makes her so popular?
Hm?

Nyamo:
Here we go!

Students:
Okay!

Yukari:
Ah-ha, I see.

Yukari:
Basketball!

Students:
Huh?

Yukari:
Now is the Basketball era!
Come sweat with your teacher and live your youth to its fullest potential.
I want everybody together inside the gymnasium!

Yukari:
Assemble now!

Yukari:
We're Team Yukari!

Tomo, Yomi:
Yay.

Osaka:
We're Team Sea Slug!

Chiyo, Kaorin:
Huh?

Chiyo:
But, why?

Kaorin:
Sea slugs are so...

Osaka:
Go Team Sea Slug!

Chiyo, Kaorin:
Yay.

Yukari:
Okay, we'll say whoever wins one game is the ultimate victor.
Also the losers get to buy the winners juice.
You got that?

Students:
What?

Kaorin:
We're making a bet?

Osaka:
Is a teacher allowed to make bets?

Yukari:
It won't be exciting unless we're betting.
Besides, like hell I'm gonna be exercising with no incentive or reward in sight.

Nyamo:
Huh?

Tomo:
All right! Yukari scores!

Chiyo:
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Yukari:
Come on!
Here you go!
Jump up!
Come on!
Get up there.
Oh...
Too bad.
Heh heh.

Nyamo:
Yukari!

Yukari:
Wha-What, Nyamo?

Nyamo:
Chiyo-chan, you wanna trade places?

Chiyo:
Yeah!

Yukari:
Hey, hey! No fair adding a teacher!

Nyamo:
You're a teacher too, aren't you?

Yukari:
What are you talking about?
You're a P.E. teacher.
It's different.

Nyamo:
Ha!

Yukari:
What the... Hey!

Tomo:
You're not getting past us!

Yomi:
We're gonna stop you!

Kaorin:
Amazing.

Yukari:
No way! Not so fast!

Nyamo:
Ha!

Tomo:
Sweet shot!

Chiyo:
Miss Kurosawa, you're totally awesome!

Osaka:
That's a P.E. teacher for ya.

Yukari:
I just played a little in high school.

Yomi:
Wow, well, it sure makes a difference when you've played seriously.

Yukari:
Yeah, but the thing is, I only joined the team part-time when they were short on people.

Chiyo:
That's so impressive!

Osaka:
You moved so fast, I could hardly see you.

Tomo:
Yeah, no kidding! But she is a P.E. teacher.

Yukari:
Aaaahhhhh!

Tomo:
Whoa, Yukari's lost it!
Come on, Yukari, stop it, please!

Yukari:
You said you wanted cola, right, Nyamo?

Nyamo:
Thanks, Yukari, I appreciate it.

Student:
Miss Kurosawa, can I talk to you for a sec?

Nyamo:
Sure.

Yukari:
Hehehehe.

Nyamo:
I'm really sorry, Yukari.
But something urgent just came up.
You can have that cola if you want it.
Bye!

Yukari:
Oh, what? But Nyamo...
Arghhhh!

03-3. Yukari's Here
Nyamo:
Yes?

Yukari:
I'm here!

Nyamo:
Yeah, yeah.

Yukari:
Yo, Nyamo!

Nyamo:
You know, it's pretty rare that you pay me a visit like this.

Yukari:
Oh, really? Is it that rare?

Nyamo:
Well, either way, come on in.

Yukari:
The thing is, there's been all kinds of construction going on since this morning.
You wouldn't believe how noisy it's gotten lately.

Nyamo:
Really?

Yukari:
Well, good night, Nyamo.

Nyamo:
You're gonna sleep?!
I don't believe this.

Yukari:
Argh! Nyamo!

Nyamo:
Yes, What is it?

Yukari:
What the heck is that?!

Nyamo:
That?

Yukari:
This! This thing! It's all squishy!

Nyamo:
Oh, I just bought that pillow the other day.

Yukari:
How much did it cost?

Nyamo:
About 10,000 yen.

Yukari:
You damn bourgeois!
Get out!

Nyamo:
And go where?

Yukari:
I'm not sure what to make of it.
This strangely rich, smooth, and springy texture is so...

Nyamo:
Comfy?
It helps you sleep really well.

Yukari:
It's French, isn't it?

Nyamo:
Actually, I think it was made in Denmark.

Yukari:
Huh.

Yukari:
You're absolutely right.

Nyamo:
You can tell?

Yukari:
All right, let's put you to the test to see how well you'll help me, Dutch boy.

Nyamo:
Dutch?

Nyamo:
Um, you've flipped the pillow upside down.


Nyamo:
Hello.

Delivery man:
I have a package for you.
It's from a Mr. Yamazaki in Hokkaido.
Here you go.

Nyamo:
Oh, it's from my uncle.

Yukari:
Hokkaido!

Nyamo:
Hey, wait a sec, Yukari!

Yukari:
When you think of Hokkaido, your mind automatically goes to fresh crabs, sea urchins, and delicious salmon stew.
What the hell?!

Nyamo:
I guess it wasn't food.
Imagine that.

Nyamo:
Hey, what do you think you are doing?

Yukari:
I'm calling this Yamazaki bastard to tell him we need to switch this with a fresh order of crabs.

Nyamo:
Huh?

Nyamo:
Yes, Hello?
Is this the Yamazaki residence by any chance?

Yukari:
Stop it!
You can't make demands about gifts, especially when they aren't yours!
Please pardon me, got the wrong number.

Yukari:
What the hell are you gonna do with this stupid bear?!

Nyamo:
I don't know.
Maybe display it by the front door...

Yukari:
You could display crabs too!

Nyamo:
You don't display crabs.

Yukari:
I got it. Return to sender!

Nyamo:
What?
Hey, Wait!

Nyamo:
Could you knock it off already?

Yukari:
Jeez, Nyamo, you're always so worried about appearances!
That's why you can't find a boyfriend.

Nyamo:
Tha... That has nothing to do with it!

Yukari:
Even in college, you were worried about it.
And while you dragged and dragged and dragged your feet,
one of our juniors went right under your nose...

Nyamo:
Argh!

Yukari:
What are you doing?
It's all true, isn't it?

Nyamo:
Some things you're allowed to say and some things you aren't.

Yukari:
You're always.... no...

Nyamo:
What are you talking about? You're just as bad! At least I know how...

Delivery man:
Excuse me, I need one of you to sign for the package.

03-4. Not My Fault
Yukari:
You wanna go out for drinks?

Nyamo:
Yes, sure.

Nyamo:
So where to? Somewhere close?
Or do you wanna go all the way to the station?

Yukari:
Hmmm.
I guess I'll leave this decision up to the sponsor this time around.

Nyamo:
Just who are you calling the sponsor?

Yukari:
I'm simply stating that it's your turn to treat me today.

Nyamo:
You mind telling me what kind of nonsense you're talking about this time?!

Yukari:
Nonsense?
It's very simple.
You'll take my part of the bill and then...

Nyamo:
Shut up! I don't wanna hear it!

Yukari:
Now, now.
I'll treat you next time we go out, okay?

Nyamo:
That's a lie!
It's a certifiable falsehood.

Yukari:
Oh, come off it!
When have I ever lied to you?

Nyamo:
Ah! Do me a favor! Stay right there!

Yukari:
What? Where are you going?

Foreigner:
Excuse me.

Nyamo:
Whoa.

Foreigner:
Blah, blah..

Nyamo:
Um, yes! <Spanish>Uno momento<Spanish>, Mr. Blah Blah.
I get friend... I get my friend, she speak your language.

Foreigner:
Oh?

Nyamo:
Oh man, where the heck did Yukari run off to at a crucial time like...Huh?
Ah! Hey, what do you think you're doing hiding here and watching?!

Yukari:
Well, it was too funny to pass up.

Nyamo:
You're the language expert!
Do something!

Yukari:
Hi! Hola Mr. Foreigner.
Blah, blah, blah...
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah...

Foreigner:
Oh! Blah, blah.

Yukari:
Blah, blah, blah, blah, biddy, blah, blah, biddy, blah, blah.

Foreigner:
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Nyamo:
Wow, it's almost like you're not stupid.

Yukari:
What did you say, you, you P.E. teacher?

Yukari:
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Foreigner:
Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Yukari:
Blah, biddy, blah, blah, biddy, blah.

Yukari, Foreigner:
Hahahahaha...

Nyamo:
Why. Hey, what's so funny? Tell me.

Yukari:
He told me that P.E. teachers are stupid where he comes from, too.
How about that?

Nyamo:
Shut up! You liar!


Yomi:
Hey, isn't that Osaka?

Tomo:
Yeah, you're right.
Osaka!
Hey, Osaka!

Osaka:
Tomo 'n' Yomi, I just want you to know that I'll never forget you two.

Tomo:
Wow, where did that come from?

Yomi:
Are you transferring again or something?

Osaka:
No, not that.
It's 'cause it's "one life, one meetin'."

Tomo:
What... is she talking about?

Yomi:
It means when you meet people you're supposed to treat the occasion as if you'll never see them again.

Tomo:
Yeah. So what about it?

Osaka:
Well, I don't really understand it.
But you just gotta cherish these "one life, one meetin'"s as they come to you.

Tomo:
Oh, now I see.
It's like that "Shame on the road is written off."

Yomi:
What?!

Osaka:
Oh, yeah, that could be a lot of fun.

Tomo:
Yeah! Let's sing at the tops of our lungs right here!

Osaka:
You know what I wanna do?
I've always wanted to try slipping on a banana peel!

Tomo:
One life, one meeting!

Osaka:
One life, one meetin'!

Tomo:
One life, one meeting!

Osaka:
One life, one meetin'!


Nyamo:
What the hell is wrong with you!
You didn't even know if a tomato was a fruit till you got into college!

Yukari:
And you were secretly taking commemorative photos in front of Senior Takeda's home!

Nyamo:
That's ancient history!

Yukari:
Oh, but I enjoy digging up people's pasts!

Nyamo:
No! Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

Tomo:
Well, going home?

Osaka:
I think so.

Yomi:
Wait. What happened to the singing?
You know "Shame on the road is written off," and all that kind of stuff?

Tomo:
I was thinking, just 'cause "you can write it off" doesn't mean "go out of your way and do something stupid."

Yomi:
A wise decision.

03-5. Forever and Ever
Yukari:
Yummy!
My friend, "shame on the road is written off," so there, my friend.

Nyamo:
What do you mean, "on the road"?
This is most definitely in our neighborhood.

Yukari:
<French>Au contraire!<French>
Neighborhood means as far as you can walk in flip-flops and not kill your feet.

Nyamo:
Fine, fine, I really don't care either way.

Yukari:
All right! Well, since it seems I've won, you get to pick up today's tab.

Nyamo:
Wait, why do I have to...

Yukari:
Oh, don't worry, don't worry.
You shouldn't sweat the small stuff so much, you know.
Hey...

Yukari:
Here, you little...

Nyamo:
I've been meaning to tell you this for a long time,
Um, you don't hold your chopsticks right way.

Yukari:
What's that?
What about my chopsticks?

Nyamo:
Huh, see the way you've got them set up, your chopsticks are running parallel to each other.
You gotta hold them so they open up in the back.

Yukari:
So, like this?

Nyamo:
No, no, no. Look here.

Yukari:
All right then, let's try it.
Like this?

Nyamo:
No, uh-uh.

Yukari:
Like this?

Nyamo:
Would you mind not breaking apart the croquettes?
Like I said, you won't pick up anything doing that.
Here, like this.

Yukari:
Oh.

Nyamo:
Pretty simple, isn't it?
Just like this.
And this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this, and this...

Yukari:
Argh!

Yukari:
Ah, yummy!
And that, my friend, is why I'm the chicken!

Nyamo:
Don't you think you've had a bit too much today?
I mean really.

Yukari:
I will be fine, Madam Captain!
I must continue until the end!

Nyamo:
Continue until what end?

Yukari:
Education!
In other words, it's like this yakitori!
I'm the meat and you're the green onions.
You get me?!

Nyamo:
No, not at all.

Yukari:
That's why you're the stupid one.

Nyamo:
What did you say, you...

Yukari:
Yukari is a language teacher, so she'll marry and get richer.

Nyamo:
Huh?

Yukari:
I'm in my happy place...

Nyamo:
He... hey! What are you... Yukari!
Oh, man! You know what happens when you pass out.

Yukari:
Sleep barfing?

Nyamo:
You better not! I'm not your maid.
Hey, don't you fall asleep!

Yukari:
What? You're the one bought that pillow, remember?!

Nyamo:
Oh, what am I supposed to do with you?

Nyamo:
Come on, walk straight!

Yukari:
I don't feel...

Nyamo:
What?!

Yukari:
<Barfing>
I'm in a bit of pinch here...

Nyamo:
Yeah, you sure are.
You're always knocking 'em back.
and each time, it's the same thing.
All right, let's go.

Yukari:
Believe in yourself!

Nyamo:
You do that.

Yukari:
I got...

Nyamo:
Honestly!
I'm gonna get us a taxi.
Let's get to the street.

Yukari:
Fire the engines!
Damn the torpedoes!

Nyamo:
Stop it!!!


-- Preview --

Tomo:
Next up is summer, swimsuits, and pool, pool, pool!

Yomi:
Hey, isn't it still spring?
I think you're getting a little ahead of yourself?

Kimura:
The pool is very nice.

Tomo:
Our uniforms'll change to short sleeves too!

Yomi:
Well, long sleeves would get hot.

Kimura:
Yes. Wearing your gym clothes...
No, no, no no.
Your swimsuits to class would be nice too.

Everyone:
Next time, summer's in full swing!
Azumanga Daioh! Look forward to it!

Kimura:
It'll be better if you're wet.

Everyone:
Shut up!

04-1. A Fun Profession

Kimura:
Okay, what does this mean
"on a great road, sheep are lost at the forks."
"Forks" refer to forks in the road.
"On a large road, there are always several forks,
and therefore you lose sight of the sheep that escaped."

Osaka:
Oh, I was wrong.

Kimura:
Basically, it's saying, there are many forks in the road of life
and it's very easy to get lost down one of them even if you don't mean to.
Thus, living your life by setting goals for yourself is the lesson of the proverb for today.
It is important for each of you to give some serious thought to the career paths you would like to follow.

Tomo:
Question!
Mr. Kimura, why did you decide to become a high school teacher?

Kimura:
'Cause I like high school girls, that's why!!

Tomo:
Hey, what was up with Kimura just now?

Yomi:
Yeah, how could he be so blunt like that?

Students:
No!

Student1:
We boys were very moved by Mr. Kimura!
He responded to us students with such whole-hearted honesty!

Yomi:
Yeah, no doubt.

Osaka:
It could turn into a real problem if we got more teachers like Mr. Kimura working here.

Tomo:
Having one is enough of a problem already.

Osaka:
Oh...

Yomi:
That's very true.
In fact, I'm surprised there hasn't been any trouble so far.

Tomo:
Maybe the school's involved in some kind of huge cover-up.

Osaka:
A suspense story, huh?

Yomi:
I don't think that's quite it.

Chiyo:
Excuse me, next hour is swimming.
If we don't go and get changed soon, then we'll be late.

Chiyo:
That's right.
I asked Miss Kurosawa if she could specially order it for me and she did.

Yomi:
Really?
How nice.

Tomo:
Ha, I'm already wearing mine under my uniform.

Yomi:
Oh, really?
How very grade school of you.

Osaka:
Oh, My!

Sakaki:
Hm?

Osaka:
An American!
There's an American among us!
Wow...

Tomo:
Ooh, she is right!
I can't believe you were in middle school just a year ago.

Sakaki:
...

Tomo:
Yeah, what?

Osaka:
You're Japanese.

Tomo:
What was that?
Well, yeah, I am Japanese, but I find it hard to accept that.

Osaka:
Nothin' wrong with bein' Japanese.

Tomo:
Um, okay, what about Yomi?

Osaka:
Um... Hawaii.

Tomo:
Hawaii?

Yomi:
Yeah, it's part of America.
Well, okay, we can split it up into three categories.
First, we have Miss Sakaki's group.

Tomo, Osaka:
Uh-huh.

Yomi:
Then, there's Kaorin and Chihiro's group.

Kaorin, Chihiro:
Huh?

Tomo, Osaka:
Uh-huh.

Osaka:
Is that where we will fall?

Yomi:
If anything, you would be...
in Chiyo-chan's group.

Tomo:
What?!

Chiyo:
Can I help you?

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, let's work real hard.

Yomi:
Well, all things considered,
Chiyo-chan will probably be in your group for only a couple more years.

Osaka:
Oh, no way.

Kaorin:
That's right.
Who knows?
You just might turn out to be like Miss Sakaki.

Tomo, Osaka:
What?!

Chiyo:
What is it? What is it, you guys, huh?!
Tell me!

Osaka:
You traitor!

Chiyo:
Huh?

Tomo:
That's right, you big traitor!

Osaka:
Traitor!...

Tomo:
Traitor!...


Yomi:
That's enough already.
We're leaving you behind.

Yomi:
Argh!

Kimura:
So, how'd it go?

Yomi:
Huh?
How... how did what go?

Kimura:
Ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, ding, diiiiiiiiing!

Yomi:
What the heck was that?

Sakaki:
A bell?

Yomi:
Like when you get the right answer on a game show?
I don't get it.

04-2. Pool, Pool, Pool
Tomo:
Oh, yeah, play hard, study hard!
There's nothing like relaxing in the pool after studying your butt off.

Yomi:
Except you haven't actually studied.

Tomo:
Shut up, that has nothing to do with it.

Nyamo:
Okay, everyone, line up!

Nyamo:
Looks like everyone's here.
So we can now...

Kimura:
...now go straight to the gym and play some basketball.

Nyamo:
Ah!

Kimura:
Oh, but it would be better if you were wet...
Shoot, what to do?

Nyamo:
Excuse me, Mr. Kimura, and...

Kimura:
I got it!
Let's take a little dip first, then we... we can go to the gym, okay?

Nyamo:
Not a chance!

Kimura:
Would volleyball be better?

Osaka:
Excuse me.

Everyone:
Huh?

Osaka:
Do you think that maybe we could play water polo?

Kimura:
Um... great.
But what does that leave me?

Nyamo:
Mr. Kimura, what about your class?

Kimura:
I had Mr. Gotoh substitute for me.

Nyamo:
You went that far...
Fine, I don't care if you want to observe, just please be quiet.

Kimura:
I understand.
It is the first day after all.

Nyamo:
Huh? What? The first day?
You mean, you plan to keep coming?

Chihiro:
One, two, three, four!

Everyone:
Five, six, seven, eight!

Chihiro:
One, two, three, four!

Everyone:
Five, six, seven, eight!

Chihiro:
One, two, three, four!

Everyone:
Five, six, seven, eight!

Chihiro:
One, two, three, four!

Everyone:
Five, six, seven, eight!

Chihiro:
One, two, three, four!

Everyone:
Five, six, seven, eight!

Chihiro:
Next! Stretching!

Tomo:
Yah...

Yomi:
What?
Don't tell me that's your limit, Osaka.

Osaka:
Mm-hm.

Yomi:
You've got some really stiff joints, you know that?
This is how you're supposed to stretch.

Osaka:
Octopus!

Tomo:
Uh-huh.
Yomi's crazy flexible 'cause her body's made of almost nothing but fat!

Yomi:
Double Chop!
Quit being so damn rude!

Tomo:
But it's the truth!

Yomi:
It is not true!

Tomo:
Jiggle, jiggle.

Yomi:
Cut it out!

Tomo:
Hey, you made a jiggling noise!

Yomi:
You better shut up!

Nyamo:
Come on, you two, quit goofing off and do your stretches!

Kimura:
Several of the water pipes that run through my house have been leaking quite a bit lately.

Nyamo:
Oh...

Kimura:
The rubber packing has probably grown very brittle and dried out.
It tends to do that when it gets old, you know.

Nyamo:
Sure, I guess so.

Kimura:
Have you grown brittle and dry?

Nyamo:
That's it!
Get out of here!

Nyamo:
Please go back to your class, Mr. Kimura.
I am in charge of P.E.

Kimura:
Then you and I should trade classes.
I'll teach P.E. during the summer, and you can teach classical lit!
What do you say, Nyamo?

Nyamo:
No, thank you.

Kimura:
Uh...

Nyamo:
All right, let's continue.

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Kimura:
I just wanted to be at the pool...
The damp feeling...

Yomi:
He's crying.

Tomo:
Yeah, he's crying for real.
It's kind of amazing in a way.

04-3. Ribbon
Nyamo:
Okay, now! Everyone, get in the water!

Tomo:
Fire one!

Chiyo:
Fire two!

Chiyo:
Thank you for saving me.

Sakaki:
It's okay.

Yomi:
I'm guessing you can't swim, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Well, I can sort of do a doggy paddle, but...

Osaka:
Now that you mention it, dogs swim using doggy paddle, right?
But just what do cats do then?

Tomo:
Oh, that's easy, they kitty paddle.

Sakaki:
Uh...
Kitty paddle...

Osaka:
If that's the case, then wouldn't it have to be Chiyo-chan paddling for Chiyo-chan?

Tomo:
Yeah, I see!

Osaka:
But, Yomi would be Yomi stroke.
She practices her Kanji even in the pool.

Tomo:
What?!
So you're this desperate to get good grades, huh?!

Yomi:
Moron.

Tomo:
What did you say?!
You really wanna study that badly?!

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki?

Tomo:
What's with you?!

Nyamo:
Hey, you girls keep it down over there!

Yukari:
Pool, p-pool, p-pool, pool!

Osaka:
Say, Miss Kurosawa?
Could you teach me the trick to gettin' faster at freestyle?

Nyamo:
The trick, huh?
Well, there's your form and then getting the timing right...

Osaka:
Oh, hang on.
First, you better tell me how to float.

Nyamo:
Huh?

Osaka:
I just always end up sinking somehow.

Tomo:
It's called not being able to swim.

Osaka:
No, I can swim, I just keep on sinking, yep.

Tomo:
What's with that?
I mean, seriously, people are lighter than water, so you should float even if you don't do anything at all.

Osaka:
Really?
Okay, but if that's true, then nobody would ever drown and die.

Tomo:
Well, the bodies of drowned people always float.

Osaka:
Oh.
I see, I gotta be a dead body.

Chiyo:
Hey, what's the matter?

Osaka:
I'm masterin' the secret to floatin' in water.

Chiyo:
That's amazing!
Can you tell me how?

Osaka:
Well, you'll see...

Yukari:
Like this!

Yukari:
It's a fact if you start drowning, your body will learn to swim real quick.

Nyamo:
Huh?

Nyamo:
Yukari, what happened to your class?!

Yukari:
Oh, I made it into a study hall.

Nyamo:
You shouldn't do that!

Yukari:
Who cares?
It made the little brats happy.
But forget that.
Let's you and me race.
Teacher versus teacher in a Steak Cup Relay!

Nyamo:
Oh, C'mon, Yukari.

Yukari:
Tell me,why is it that we get paid the same, but you get to be at the pool while I'm stuck in the lousy classroom, huh?!

Nyamo:
Because I am a P.E. teacher and you are a language teacher, remember?

Yukari:
Then I quit being a language teacher!
Starting today, I'm a P.E. teacher!

Nyamo:
Don't be absurd!

Kimura:
Then, let us do this.
Classical lit and language classes, starting today, will be held right here in this pool.

Nyamo:
Mr. Kimura, do you mind telling me how you got in here?!
You too for that matter!

Yukari:
Me? I used an extra key.

Nyamo:
Extra key?
Where did you get that?

Yukari:
It was in your drawer, Nyamo.

Nyamo:
How dare you go in my drawer!

Kimura:
Also, bikinis should be mandatory attire for all female... students...

Yukari:
... I'm collecting my debt!

Nyamo:
Yukari!
That was back in high school!

Yukari:
Yeah, so what?
It's accumulated a lot of interest!
Pay up!

Nyamo:
Yukari!

04-4. Just the Two of Them
Sakaki:
You okay?

Chiyo:
Yeah, thanks for all the times you helped me out.

Sakaki:
Oh.

Osaka:
But you're amazin', Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Why do you say that?

Osaka:
'Cause you mastered the secret already.

Chiyo:
What? You really think so?

Osaka:
Yeah, you're really somethin'.
But how come you're still alive?

Sakaki:
There.

Chiyo:
Huh?


Student:
Come on, Yukari!

Student:
Don't lose, Nyamo!

Student:
Go for it, Yukari!

Student:
Come on, show your best!
You can do it!

Kimura:
Uhh...

Chiyo:
All right, we'll hereby commence the very first teacher versus teacher's Steak Cup Relay!

Tomo:
Come on! Kick her ass, Nyamo!

Chihiro:
Score a win, Miss Yukari!

Kaorin:
Go for it!

Chiyo:
Get ready!
Go!

Chihiro:
Ow, that hurt.

Yomi:
She's fast!

Tomo:
That's our Nyamo!

Yukari:
Damn P.E. teacher!
All right then...
Let's see how she likes this!
Interference!

Yukari:
Ow! Ow! Ow! Ow!
I got a cramp! I got a cramp in my leg! Argh!

Nyamo:
Honestly, Yukari!

Yukari:
Ow, ow, could you be more gentle?

Nyamo:
You brought it on yourself.
Deal with it.

Yukari:
You're hurting me!

Chiyo:
Miss Yukari and Miss Kurosawa will serve as the anchors and compete one more time, so we'll start over with the second person in line.
Is everyone clear?

Everyone:
Yes!

Nyamo:
I should have just left you there.

Yukari:
Nyamo, you're too soft when you have a chance to make checkmate.
That's why, when it comes to men...
Argh!

Chiyo:
Are you both ready?

Tomo:
Yeah!

Chiyo:
Then here we go again!
Get set!
Go!

Chiyo:
All right!
Let's go!
All right! Paddle, paddle, paddle!

Osaka:
Tomo's got a lot of energy.

Chiyo:
That may be true, but it looks like she's all splash and no speed.

Kagura:
Ha!

Osaka:
You can do it!

Yomi:
Go for it!

Nyamo:
Go for the gold!

Yukari:
Go for the steak!

Kaorin:
You can do it, Chiyo!

Tomo:
Osaka, what are you doing?!

Yukari:
How about we play fair this time, okay?

Nyamo:
Look who's talking!

Yukari:
See ya!

Chiyo:
Team Miss Kurosawa wins the race.

04-5. A Good Person?
Yomi:
Hey, is that a book on swimming?

Chiyo:
Yes. I borrowed it from the library during the lunch break.
We'll be sure to win the relay race next time!

Yomi:
I see you were on Team Yukari, huh, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Next time, we'll win Miss Yukari her steak dinner for sure.

Yomi:
Uh, yeah...

Tomo:
Ha!
You can try all you want, but we're gonna win no matter what, so there!

Chiyo:
Oh yeah, like you were a real big part of the victory!
Why should I listen to you?

Tomo:
Haha, as long as we win in the end, it doesn't matter!
Ha ha, loser team, loser team!
I know it was a Steak Cup Relay Race,
but I'm gonna let you off if you buy me some soft serve ice cream.
Hahaha, are you gonna cry? Hahaha...

Yomi:
What are we, in grade school?


Yukari:
Man, I don't know what's got into me today.

Kimura:
I'm leaving now, bye.

Nyamo:
See you tomorrow.

Nyamo:
Come on, Yukari, ready to go?

Yukari:
Go where?

Nyamo:
"Steak Cup Relay Race"? I won, remember?
You are going to treat me, right?

Yukari:
No, no, that's not what I meant at all.
I was simply naming it in honor of all the steak you and I have eaten over the years.
It's kinda like the Japan Cup that way.

Nyamo:
You're such a liar...

Yukari:
Okay, okay, since you insist on being a royal pain, we can bet a steak dinner for the second Steak Cup Relay Race.

Nyamo:
There's no second time!

Osaka:
Oh!

Yomi:
What is it?

Chiyo:
Oh, it's Mr. Kimura.

Yomi:
What is he doing there?

Tomo:
Uh...

Chiyo:
It seems like he's looking for something.

Tomo:
Think he lost his wallet or something?

Yomi:
Or maybe his pet?

Osaka:
Oh!
I know, he's probably lookin' for the entrance.

Everyone:
Entrance to what?

Tomo:
But don't you think it's pretty suspicious?
It smells like some kind of plot.

Yomi:
Like what kind?

Tomo:
Oh, you know... like maybe he buried something under that tree.

Yomi:
What do you mean?
Like money?

Tomo:
Uh-uh, like a body.

Chiyo:
Um... You, you mean murder?

Tomo:
Yeah.

Yomi:
Uh, I see.
Then, that bag he had on him must be holding the weapon that he committed the crime with.

Tomo:
Mmm-hmmm.

Osaka:
It's a real mystery.

Chiyo:
What?
But we don't know whether the story is even true or not.

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, you better be careful, or you might get buried too.
We should all be careful and stay on the lookout.

Osaka:
There goes the suspect, now.

Kimura:
You there.

Man:
Oh! Oh, thank you very much, as always.

Tomo:
No way!

Osaka:
That was 10,000 yen.

Kimura:
Oh, hello girls.

Yomi:
Mr. Kimura, he said, always?

Kimura:
Of course, it's my duty as a teacher.

Osaka:
Mr. Kimura, what's in that bag you got there?

Kimura:
Oh, these are empty cans.
You should properly dispose of trash in a receptacle.
And you should sort it accordingly.

Everyone:
Huh?

Kimura:
Good-bye.

Everyone:
Oh...

Chiyo:
You see that?
Mr. Kimura really did turn out to be a normal person after all.

Yomi:
Just one of those easily misunderstood types, huh?

Osaka:
Oh.

Kimura:
Man, what I wouldn't give to watch them changing.

Everyone:
Uhh...

Tomo:
Misunderstood, huh?

Yomi:
Let's try not to think too hard about it.

-- Preview --

Osaka:
Durin' summer break, I like to just sleep and do nothin'.
Just sit and space out in a room with air conditionin'.

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, you should do your homework over the break too!
If you'd like, you can come to our summer home and...

Everyone:
Summer home?!

Osaka:
Next Azumanga Daioh, we'll get to watch me spend just such a day...

Everyone:
Summer home?!

Osaka:
If you tell summer night horror stories, how many stairs does each story have?

05-1. Summer Break
Yukari:
Your fun summer break will be starting tomorrow!
So, who's got fun plans? Anyone?

Student:
Me! My family's going to New Zealand.

Yukari:
Oh my, sounds great.

Kaorin:
Um, I'm going to Astronomy camp.

Yukari:
Oh my, sounds great.

Chiyo:
Um... Will you be going on vacation too?

Yukari:
Why, of course! I'm flying to Neptune.

Yukari:
Okay, time to pass out report cards!

Student:
Hey, what's up with this stuff?

Yukari:
All right!
Those of you who got drills with your report cards will stay here until you finish them! Chop chop!


Sakaki:
I wonder if he gets hot sitting there with the sun beating down on him.

Yukari:
Good morning.

Nyamo:
It's early evening, you know.
What?
Have you turned into a night owl since the break started?

Yukari:
Night owl?
I sleep at night, duh.

Nyamo:
I don't believe you.
Come and sit down here!

Yukari:
What?

Nyamo:
I'm telling you to sit!

Yukari:
Oh, would you just shut up?

Yukari:
What do you wanna do so early in the morning?

Nyamo:
I told you, it's early evening!
Set up a daily schedule!
You shouldn't be so lazy just because it's summer break!

Yukari:
What's your deal?
Are you some kind of school teacher?

Nyamo:
We both are.

Yukari:
I can't write anything with you watching me!

Nyamo:
Fine, fine.

Nyamo:
Done yet?

Yukari:
I got it!

Nyamo:
Show me.

Nyamo:
What is this?
You have no drive.

Yukari:
No, I certainly don't.

Nyamo:
Summer break is a great opportunity; don't you wanna spend some of your time productively?
Read a book or plan your lessons for the next semester or something?!

Yukari:
Jeez, would you put a lid on already... Oh!

Nyamo:
What is it?

Yukari:
Let's go have fun somewhere tomorrow!

Nyamo:
Have fun, huh?

Yukari:
What the hell is your problem, Nyamo? It's better than being lazy, isn't it?!

Nyamo:
I can't.

Yukari:
Oh, you can't.

Nyamo:
Look, I can't help it.
I've got swimming tomorrow!

Yukari:
"I can't help it.
I've got swimming."
Swimming?!

Nyamo:
What?

Yukari:
The pool, right?! I'm coming with you!

Nyamo:
It's the school pool!
I'm the advisor for the swim team.

Yukari:
Hold on a second.
The school pool would be free, right?

Nyamo:
I'm telling you, I'm not going there to have fun!

Yukari:
What do you want from me?
It's better than being lazy, isn't it?!
It's better than that!

Nyamo:
I can't help it, I'm the teacher.

Yukari:
I'm a teacher too.

Nyamo:
Yes, of course you are.

Yukari:
Hey, I know.

Nyamo:
You know...
You still have no motivation.

Yukari:
Uh... score two for Nyamo...


Yukari:
You've gotta be in a swimsuit for the summer!
I'm going for a little more fanservice this year!
Check it out!
Two times as much!

Yukari:
Ta-da!
Check out my awesome shark!

Kagura:
Miss Kurosawa, that woman in Lane 8 is in a world by herself.

Nyamo:
Don't let her bother you.

Kagura:
But I can't help it. She does bother me.

05-2. Welcome to Chiyo's Room
Tomo:
Summer Break Special, Home Inspections!
We're going to Chiyo-chan's today!
Yay!

Tomo:
Hey, hey, where are you going, Yomi?!

Yomi:
Your shouting in front of the train station is embarrassing.

Tomo:
Oh, give it a rest.
Don't be such a stick in the mud.
You know what they say: "Three makes a rowdy bunch", right?

Yomi:
Yeah, and I want no part of that.

Osaka:
Are we a rowdy bunch, Mister?

Tomo:
Ah! I get it, I get it! Okay?

Osaka:
So, so I...

Man:
Eh?

Tomo:
Let's see...
Summer Break Special, Home Inspections!
We're going to Chiyo-chan's today!
Yay!

Tomo:
Hey, hey, Yomi, where are you going?!

Yomi:
Your simple presence is killing my ears.

Tomo:
Hey c'mon, I can't help it. Give me a break.
So, our presence is a little rowdy, so what?

Yomi:
Don't be lumping me in the same group as you.

Osaka:
Hey, Mister, would you say our simple presence is too rowdy for ya?

Tomo:
Ah! I get it already!
Once we're at Chiyo-chan's, I'm not gonna let you make copies with me, Osaka.

Osaka:
Make copies?

Tomo:
That's right!
So, we don't wastefully wile away our happy summer break.
I've made shrewd and daring plans to copy Chiyo-chan's homework!

Yomi:
Oh, I see. So that's the real reason why...

Tomo:
Hey!

Osaka:
Oh, I'm just not shrewd that way.

Tomo:
Ha! And I'm not gonna let you copy mine!

Yomi:
I don't want it.

Tomo:
Why not?!

Yomi:
I'll do it myself.

Tomo:
Well, isn't that great, Miss Smarty Pants.
Must be nice having your figure too.
Look at me and get carried away with my oh-so-cool summer style.

Osaka:
But do y'all have boyfriends to show off your style too?

Yomi:
I'm gonna buy some cake so we have a gift for Chiyo-chan.

Tomo:
Yay! Cake!
I can't believe we're having cake!
Yomi, you're the greatest!

Osaka:
Cake! Yay!


Everyone:
Wow...

Tomo:
Hey, shouldn't we be getting there soon?

Yomi:
Yeah, we're in the right neighborhood for the address.

Tomo:
Wow... do you think this is really the place?

Yomi:
The nameplate says it's Chiyo-chan's house.

Osaka:
Amazin'...

Tomo:
It won't self-destruct, will it?

Yomi:
Not likely.

Yomi:
There's no need to sprint off!

Chiyo:
Hi!
Come on in!
I've been expecting you.

Yomi:
I-I said there's no need to sprint off!

Tomo:
Wow, I think maybe we should've splurged and bought 'er a melon.

Yomi:
I think we'll be okay keeping it simple.

Chiyo:
Hello and welcome to my home, everybody!
This is the first time my high school friends are visiting, so I'm very happy!
Now, please don't be so formal; come on in!

Tomo:
Um, uh, thank you for having us.

Chiyo:
We have lots of rooms, but this one is mine!

Tomo:
Wow!

Osaka:
It's huge.

Tomo:
Man, Chiyo-chan, this is one awesome place you got here.

Chiyo:
Oh, it's not that great.

Yomi:
Trust me, it's pretty great.

Tomo:
Well, yeah, it's like you've practically won already.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Right, Osaka?

Osaka:
Huh? Yeah, let's all go have fun somewhere.

Everyone:
Huh?

Yomi:
If we coulda, then we woulda.

Osaka:
So, why doncha?

Tomo:
Ugh... the money...

Yomi:
Huh...

Chiyo:
Hey, I know, we can all go to my summer home!
What do you say?

Yomi, Tomo:
Su... Summer home?!

Osaka:
Summer home?


05-3. Invitation
Tomo:
Summer break special! Home inspections!
Today we're going to Chiyo-chan's summer home!
Yay!

Osaka:
Sure turned out to be a nice day.
It's a perfect day for goin' to a summer home.

Tomo:
Well, yeah, maybe it is and maybe it isn't, but...
Chiyo-chan, you invited Miss Sakaki, right?

Chiyo:
Yes!
I saw her at the library, so I asked her.
Was that wrong?

Tomo:
What do you think?!
It's A-Okay! Good job! Yay!

Chiyo:
Yay!

Tomo:
However!
These guys, who invited these guys?!

Yukari:
Don't call us "these guys"!
Thanks to us, you're getting car rides!
Free transportation, kids! Free!

Tomo:
Okay, sure, that's true, but...

Yukari:
I see. Miss Takino, you're taking the train, ehhhh?

Tomo:
What?!
Yay! Car trip! Car trip! We're goin' on a car trip! Wooo!

Yukari:
Now that that's settled.
Let's split up into groups!
Who wants to go in my car!
My, I mean my parents' car costs more, FYI!

Osaka:
Miss Yukari?

Yukari:
Yeah, what?

Osaka:
Whatever it might have cost, this car's got dents all over the place.

Yukari:
Don't worry about it.
You can't live a full life if all you do is worry.

Osaka:
But...

Nyamo:
Well... I guess I'll take three and Yukari'll take two.

Chiyo:
Excuse me, but Miss Yukari's car looks a lot roomier than yours, so shouldn't she be the one to take three people with her?

Nyamo:
The fewer fatalities, the better, right?

Everyone:
Aaaaaaaah!!
Rock, paper...

Yukari:
Wow, that's a nice looking summer home!
Fresh air and a great location by the seaside!

Yomi:
I saw everything.

Osaka:
We, we ain't, we ain't afraid of roller coasters no more.

Tomo:
Wow! It's the ocean, the ocean, the ocean!
Yeah, we're at the ocean... Let's go!
Melon time!

Yomi:
Yes, melon smashing is a common pastime, but don't we need a stick or a bat or something?

Tomo:
Huh? Any bats on the ground?! Any bats?! Huh? Huh, huh?

Yomi:
No...

Osaka:
Melon smashin', huh?

Chiyo:
Oh...

Sakaki:
So, what's up?

Chiyo:
What do you have to do to get to be big like that?

Tomo:
Ha, we don't need a bat!
Spirit all the way!


Osaka:
So, hemorrhoids...

Sakaki:
Hm?

Osaka:
Let's say you're writin' the word "hemorrhoids" in hiragana, you put the dots on the "chi," don't ya?
Not like you normally do with "shi."

Sakaki:
Uh, yeah.

Osaka:
But when I was lookin' it up in the dictionary, I was real surprised 'cause it was written with a dotted "shi."

Sakaki:
Oh, really?

Osaka:
You know seals, right?

Sakaki:
Huh?

Osaka:
It's "sea" plus "leopard" in kanji.

Sakaki:
Is... is that a fact?

Osaka:
I guess they must be pretty ferocious.
But they look awful cuddly.

Sakaki:
Oh...
You're fairly... knowledgeable.

Osaka:
You think so?

Osaka:
Speakin' of the sea,
I think I'd like to ride a dolphin.

Sakaki:
That'd be nice.

Osaka:
Wouldn't it?

Osaka:
Okay, so, you know how we write "dolphins" as "sea pig"?

Sakaki:
Uh-huh.

Osaka:
But we use the same character for "pig" in "river pig", and somehow it comes out as "puffer fish", but they live in the sea.

Sakaki:
Uh-huh.

Yomi:
What are you two up to?

Osaka:
Oh, thinkin' about hemorrhoids.

Sakaki:
No, we weren't!

05-4. Someone With Experience, Speak
Osaka:
Summer break special.
How to fully enjoy summer nights.
It ain't a summer night unless you tell horror stories.

Yomi:
Well, that may be pretty standard, but do you know any really scary ones?

Osaka:
No, I don't know any.

Yomi:
Then, who cares.

Chiyo:
Oh, that reminds me!
This is a story about another summer home.

Yomi:
Oh. Yeah? Yeah? Go on!

Chiyo:
It seems they had an enormous outbreak of cockroaches one summer.

Yomi:
Then? Then what?

Chiyo:
Giant cockroaches crawling everywhere all over the...

Tomo:
Ya!
Summer nights are for dirty tales!

Osaka:
Dirty tales?

Tomo:
Oh, yeah!
So, let's take this moment to get the two adults here to tell us stories that we can really learn from!

Yukari:
Huh?

Tomo:
Come on, tell us a story from your vast store of adult experiences,
starting with Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
Who, me?

Tomo:
Yup!

Yukari, Nyamo:
Um...

Chiyo:
Please, no dirty stories, please no!

Yomi:
Lay off, they're too stunned to answer.

Tomo:
We're all waiting on you!

Tomo:
Yukari, a word!

Yukari:
Uh... being as a single woman really isn't that bad.

Tomo:
Huh...
That doesn't help us at all.

Osaka:
Hey, Miss Kurosawa, you look popular.

Nyamo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Now, please, Miss Kurosawa!
We're waiting!

Nyamo:
Um... Well, you see...
Um... I'm single too, so... I don't have any stories like that.
Sorry, seems I failed you girls.

Tomo:
Uh... darn...

Yukari:
Maybe, but you weren't single last summer, Nyamo.

Tomo:
What?

Nyamo:
.....

Chiyo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Oh, I think that killed the mood right there.

Osaka:
Oh, I know.

Tomo:
Yeah, what's that?
Horror stories again?

Osaka:
Sometimes, you get serial killings with this kinda situation in a drama.

Yomi:
Yeah, that's true.

Osaka:
First one, then another...
You think that you haven't seen somebody for a while, but actually...

Tomo:
Ooh, creepy...
So, so then what?

Osaka:
Victim number one would be Tomo.
Then, one by one, y'all get killed...
So you see...

Tomo:
What? See what?

Osaka:
I am the murderer.

Yomi:
So, you're the murderer?

Tomo:
Oh, man, that story was lame.
Oh, I know!
I'll tell you what summer nights are for.

Osaka:
Haha...


Yukari:
There! There! Go! Go! Go!

Nyamo:
Oh, yeah. She's excited about them now, since she didn't have to pay for them.

Chiyo:
You're real good with sparklers, Miss Sakaki.


Sakaki:
Huh, this place is great.
I wish we could stay here and didn't have to go home.

Chiyo:
Oh, yes.
But...

Sakaki:
But?

Chiyo:
I really like to make it home alive.

Sakaki:
The Yukari-mobile...

Chiyo:
I'm not good at rock-paper-scissors!


Sakaki:
And today was the last day of summer break, too.

05-5. Done For
Tomo:
Good morning!
Hey, how've you guys been?
I brought all the photos from our trip over summer break!

Kaorin:
Let me see! Let me see!

Chiyo:
Me too!

Kaorin:
I really wish I could've come.
If only it hadn't been at the same time as my club's camp.
Then I would've...
Ah... Mi-i-i-i... M... Mi-i-i-iss Sakaki went with you too?!

Tomo:
Well, yeah.

Kaorin:
Well then, why on earth didn't I go?!

Tomo:
You said yourself you had camp.

Kaorin:
Huh? Noooooooo!!!

Tomo:
Oh, that?
I guess I toss and turn a lot in my sleep.

Kaorin:
But why?!

Tomo:
Um, no real reason...

Kaorin:
Uh? What's this?

Tomo:
Oh! That's the Yukari-mobile.

Kaorin:
Ah, so this is it...
I heard you had a rough time, Chiyo-chan.
Chiyo-chan?

Tomo:
Chiyo!

Chiyo:
Will you please stop the car?
Miss Yukari, please stop.
Please stop.
Please be more careful...
I'm sorry.
Oh, don't. We're going to die.
Grandpa...
Look out!
Mister grandpa!
Mister grandpa!
Look out!
Run away!
Run away!


Tomo:
Miss Sakaki, I've got some photos for you.

Sakaki:
Photos from my very first trip with friends...
Thanks, Tomo.

Tomo:
Hey, check that out.
If you look real close, you can see a ghost face behind you.

Sakaki:
Oh!

Yomi:
Oh, you're right.

Chiyo:
Huh?
Oh wow, you're so lucky to have a photo like that.

Osaka:
Huh? Hey, that's my neighbor Mr. Horikoshi from back when I was in Osaka.

Well, probably.


Yukari:
That's right.
Today starts the second semester!
Let's all make sure we study hard!
So, summer break is officially over now.
Did everyone go somewhere and have lots of fun?

Student:
All sorts of stuff happened, so we didn't go anywhere.

Yukari:
Oh, my. Isn't that just too bad?

Kaorin:
The only thing I did was Astronomy camp.

Yukari:
Oh, my. Isn't that just too bad?

Yukari:
All right!
Listen up now!
The more fun your summer break was, the worse your summer break hangover it's gonna be.
Is everyone in class clear on this matter?

Tomo:
Then you must be in the worst shape of all of us!

Yukari:
Bingo! Just like you say!
Oh, man.
When's winter break again?


-- Preview --

Yukari:
The theme of the next episode of Azumang Daioh is "victory"!
Hold the word "victory" dear to your heart, put your spirit into it and win!

Osaka:
Miss Yukari, you're really into this.
You've got your heart set on this Sports Fest, huh?

Yukari:
When I say win, I mean against Class 5! Nyamo's class!

Yomi:
You wouldn't happen to have your heart set on something more?

Yukari:
If we win, I'll treat you!

06-1. Equation For Victory
Kimura:
Yes, that's right.
The sports fest is coming up.

Tomo:
Hm?

Chiyo Osaka:
Huh?

Yomi:
Huh?

Kimura:
I feel that, for P.E. uniforms, it's better to tuck your shirt into your bloomers.

Student:
Mr. Kimura, for the guys' uniforms, which is better? Tuck or don't tuck?

Kimura:
Uh, what on earth are you talking about?
We're in the middle of class.

Student:
Huh?


Osaka:
The sports fest is comin'.
A Tokyo sports fest.

Yomi, Kaorin:
Hm?

Osaka:
Well, I've never done a sports fest in Tokyo before, so I'm lookin' forward to it.

Yomi:
Is there some difference between Tokyo and Osaka?

Osaka:
Oh, yeah. It's real different.

Kaorin:
So, how's it different?

Osaka:
In Osakan sports fest, first place wins you fried octopus balls.

Sorry. I lied.

Tomo:
When it comes to sports fest, the spotlight is gonna shine on me!
Ooh, I'm pants! I'm on fire!

Osaka:
Spotlight?

Yomi:
For what?

Tomo:
Short sprint, medium sprint, marathons, long jump, high jump, basket scramble, cavalry battle.
I'm aiming to win the top prize in every event!

Yomi:
Well, it's easy enough for anyone to aim to win.

Tomo:
Hahaha.

Kaorin:
Heh, you got no hope, Tomo.

Tomo:
What?!

Kaorin:
Because you have to beat Miss Sakaki.
Miss Sakaki is good at any and every sport.
There's no way you can win.
Oh, I just know she's going to be totally cool out there!

Tomo:
Huh, then I'll just have to compete with my cuteness!

Yomi, Kaorin:
Huh?

Tomo:
I'll make an appeal to everyone based on how cute I am.
We'll pick me or Miss Sakaki in a massive school wide vote.
And then, the victory will be mine!

Kaorin:
What are you talking about?!
Being cool is better than being cute!
Way better!

Tomo:
Oh, yeah? I say it's being cute!

Kaorin:
No, being cool!

Tomo:
Being cute!

Tomo:
Hey, Yomi, which one do you think is better?

Yomi:
I really couldn't care less.


Yukari:
Listen up, everyone!
I have one word that I wanna say to all of you!
And that word... is first place!

Everyone:
Huh?

Osaka:
What's first place?

Yukari:
Put all your fighting spirit into the sports fest!
And we'll be sure to win!
We have to win against Class 5!

Osaka:
So, what's wrong with Class 5?

Kaorin:
You know, Miss Kurosawa's homeroom class.

Osaka:
Oh.

Yukari:
In any case, think about winning, no matter what!
You're free to use whatever means you feel necessary!

Yomi:
Whatever means necessary?

Tomo:
Hey, if we win, you should treat us all to a can of juice!

Yukari:
Juice, huh?
Let's see, if we're looking at 120 yen a can...
Okay! If you guys win, I'll treat you all!

Yomi:
Just how much did you bet on this?


Osaka:
I hope it's gonna be clear tomorrow.

Chiyo:
I'll put up a tell-weather-doll for luck.

Osaka:
Better yet I'll do something right now.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Let's see what side of mine's on.

Chiyo:
Oh, that way we can predict the weather.

Osaka:
There.
Uh...


Sakaki:
Aw, Aw, Aw...

06-2. Sakaki of Class 3, Kagura of Class 5
Kaorin:
Hey, Chihiro, what events are you in?

Chihiro:
Relay and cavalry battle.

Tomo:
Too bad, Miss chunky pony can't ride!

Yomi:
Shut up.

Chiyo:
It's a clear day.

Osaka:
I guess that shoe must have landed right side up.


Announce:
The sports fest will be coming voluntarily.
At first, we have an opening speech from the Executive Sports Fest Committee Chairman.

Everyone:

Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka, Chiyo:
Hehehe.

Chiyo:
Here we go.

Osaka:
Okay, I'm ready.

Tomo:
All right, time for some serious stretching, baby!

Yomi:
You're certainly energetic.

Tomo:
Come on, I'll push you from behind!

Yomi:
Y-You will?

Tomo:
One, two...

Yomi:
Argh

Yukari:
We're not gonna lose to your class!

Nyamo:
I wouldn't be so sure now.

Yukari:
Why shouldn't I?
My class has Sakaki.
There's no way we'll lose so... yeah.

Nyamo:
Hey, my class has a star athlete too.

Yukari:
What?! No fair!
That's cheating!
You big such a cheater!

Nyamo:
Yeah, how's that?

Yukari:
All right!

Yukari:
Hey, hey.
The star athlete from Class 5?
Do you know her?

Chihiro:
From Class 5?

Kaorin:
Oh, that would have to be Miss Kagura.

Yukari:
Kagura?

Kaorin:
That's her over there.

Kaorin:
She belongs to Miss Kurosawa's swim team.
Rumor has it that she's good at all sports, not just swimming.

Yukari:
Huh...

Yukari:
Miss Kagura?
Say, would you like a sweet bun?

Kagura:
Huh?

Yukari:
Here you go.

Kagura:
Um... but...

Yukari:
Here.

Nyamo:
Hold it, Yukari!
What do you think you're doing?!

Yukari:
Darn.

Tomo:
Hey, gather around, everyone!
Well, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Yes?

Tomo:
How about a word of encouragement to everyone.

Chiyo:
Oh...

Well, Um...
You do your best... But if I...

Everyone:
Huh?

Chiyo:
If... if I start dragging everyone down and we end up losing all because of me...

Yomi:
It's okay, Chiyo-chan, don't worry.
The sports fest is just a game.
So, just do what you can.

Yukari:
Okay, everyone!

Everyone:
Huh?

Yukari:
Now, listen up!
We win today, no matter what!
Don't get any soft ideas that the sports fest is just a game and drag everyone down!

Chiyo:
Oh...

Yukari:
Is that clear?

Chiyo:
Um... Excuse me...

Yukari:
Hurray, everyone!
Let's see some spirit!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yukari:
What's wrong, Chiyo-chan?
I can't hear you!
One more time!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Chiyo:
All right!

Tomo:
Wow, it's a runaway victory.

Chiyo:
She was first in the 100-meter too.

Kaorin:
She's like the best ever!

Kimura:
Don't be so hasty.

Everyone:
Huh?

Kimura:
Don't be so hasty!
Did dress yourself so sloppily.

Everyone:
Ahh!

Kimura:
Now, tuck in your shirts, all of you.

Tomo:
Shut up, beat it out, shut up, okay?!

Announce:
Next up is the three-legged race.

Osaka, Chiyo:
Let's do it.

Man:

Chiyo:
Let's take our timing and count our steps, okay?

Osaka:
Okay, nice and slow.

Osaka, Chiyo:
One... Ow...

Nyamo:
Heave and try to pull together, you can do it!

Everyone:
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

Osaka:
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!
I wonder what I was chanting for.
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

Everyone:
Heave-ho! Heave-ho!

Osaka:
Hey, Tomo, you ever wondered why you had to chant like this?

Tomo:
No! Now, shut up and pull!

Tomo:
Hey, that gymnastics stuff looks like fun, huh.

Chiyo:
They're amazing.

Tomo:
Chiyo-chan, let's do a handstand!

Chiyo:
What? But...

Tomo:
Don't worry, I'll support you.

Chiyo:
You... Really?

Tomo:
Tweet.

Yomi:
Tomo!

Tomo:
Eh?

Chiyo:
Argh.

06-4. Yay
Yomi:
Actually, our score is not all that bad, huh.

Chiyo:
Not bad?
We're now ready to be the top class in our year.

Tomo:
Oh, yeah, but, look.

Yomi:
Hm, we're still a little behind Class 5.

Chiyo:
That's because I'm a burden, right?

Yomi:
You know that's not true.

Chiyo:
But I... I haven't been of any use at all today.

Tomo:
Oh, yeah, but who cares.

Chiyo:
Ah...

Chihiro:
Chiyo-chan, it's time now.
Say, did something happen?

Yomi:
Well, this and that.

Chihiro:
Huh?

Announce:
Next up is the cheering contest.

Class 3, all right, stand up and fight!

Woman:
Who's that girl?
She's so cute!

Class 3:
Class 3, all right, stand up and fight!

Nyamo:
Wow, they're a big hit!

Yukari:
Oh, yeah, but it doesn't win us any points.

Announce:
Next up, scavenger race!

Chihiro:
Good luck, Miss Osaka!

Let me borrow your glasses!
Your glasses!

School swimsuit!

Osaka:
Ah... Ah...

Yomi:
No one said you had to put 'em on!

Announce:
Now, for our final competition.
Class versus class relay.

Chiyo:
If we win this, we can turn the tables and come in first!

Osaka:
Yeah!

Man:
On your mark!

Nyamo:
I guess this is it, huh.

Yukari:
Win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win, win!

Man:
Get set!

Chiyo:
Miss Chihiro, go for it!

Nyamo:
Be careful when you pass the baton!

Tomo:
Come on, Chihiro!

Chiyo:
Wow! Tomo's really getting into it.

Kaorin:
Yeah, but she isn't closing the distance at all.

Osaka:
You're right.
She's fallin' behind.

Nyamo:
All right, that's the spirit! Way to Go!

Tomo:
Catch them!

Yomi:
I'm on it!

Chiyo:
Go for it, Miss Yomi!

Osaka:
Come on!

Nyamo:
Now just do your best and get it to Kagura!

Yukari:
Yomi, get it to Sakaki, so we can win!
Don't you dare drop the baton!

Yomi:
It's up to you!

Chiyo:
Go, Miss Sakaki!

Yukari:
That's it, Sakaki!
Come from behind!

Nyamo:
Don't lose it now!

Yukari:
We got it!

Nyamo:
Kagura, don't let her go!

Yukari:
Oh...

Nyamo:
Leave her in the dust!

Yukari:
How dare you say that?!

Nyamo:
What the hell is wrong with cheering for my own class, Yukari?!

Yukari:
Nothing, nothing at all!

Yukari:
Kick her ass, Sakaki!

Nyamo:
Kagura!

Osaka:
You can do it, Miss Sakaki!
I just admire things.

Everyone:
Yay!

Yukari:
We won, hahaha, we won!

Nyamo:
Yeah, yeah.

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki, you were awesome!

Chiyo:
You did it for us.
We're the winners of our year now!

Kimura:
Hurray!

Yomi:
This has nothing to do with you!

06-5. Dancing the Grand Finale

Everybody, thank you for your hard work.
We are now thinking of concluding this event with a folkdance.

Miss Sakaki! Miss Sakaki! Miss Sakaki! Miss Sakaki!
Oh, our hands! Our hands! Our hands! Our hands! Our hands!
It's Heaven, heaven, heaven, heaven!
If we could just stay like this,
if we could just stay like this,
if we could just stay like this,
I could die! I could die! I could die!
I could die right now!

Sakaki:
Um...
It's time for us to switch off...

Kaorin:
Oh, I... I'm so sorry.

Sakaki:
Bye.

Kaorin:
I'm so glad I participated in the folkdance.

Kimura:
Hey, baby! Let's tango!

Kaorin:
Ah...

Kimura:
Hahahahaha...

Kaorin:
My hands, my hands, my hands, he's touching my hands.
I wish I were dead! I wish I were dead! I wish Iwere dead!
I wish I were dead! I wish I were dead!...

Kimura:
Are you having fun, dear Kaorin?!

Kaorin:
Only my friends can call me that!


Nyamo:
I know we weren't able to win today, but all of you did really well.
Let's work at it again next year.

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am.

Nyamo:
Come on, there's nothing for you to cry about.

Kagura:
Yes, ma'am.

Yukari:
Hey!
Gimme what you promised!
C'mon, fork it over!

Kagura:
What did you promise her?

Nyamo:
Ooh, it's nothing! Oh, it's nothing at all!

Nyamo:
This is why I said I didn't wanna do it.

Yukari:
Never mind that, just hurry up, will ya?

Nyamo:
Here.

Yukari:
Yes!

Nyamo:
Oh, that 10,000 yen you borrowed,
I'll take it back, thank you.

Yukari:
Say what?

Nyamo:
Okay, everyone, it's time to go home.

Kagura:
Um, Coach, what's that money for?

Nyamo:
Oh, nothing really.
Wait, I know, I think I'll treat everyone to juice with this money.
Okay, let's go.

Tomo:
Hey, Yukari! Hey!
You promised, remember?

Yukari:
Huh?

Tomo:
Hey, we won, so let's have our juice now.

Yukari:
Your juice, huh?

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yukari:
Oh...
Oh!

Everyone:
Huh?

Yomi:
Man, she's fast.

Tomo:
Mm-hm.

Osaka:
No kiddin'
She should've been in the sports fest herself.

-- Preview --

Yomi:
Next week, we'll finally be having our culture fest.

Chiyo:
We didn't have culture fests in grade school, I can't wait!

Osaka:
Let's see, there's the Bon dance for summer festivals, and the forkdance for sports fests, so what do you dance for culture fests?

Tomo:
That'd be the culture dance!
Culture! Culture! Culture! Culture! Yeah!

Yomi:
You do that culture dance of yours.

Tomo:
That'd be the culture dance!
Culture! Culture! Culture! Yeah!

07-1. Fairyland Class
Chiyo:
During today's homeroom hour, I would like to decide what we should do for the culture fest.
Does anybody have any ideas they'd like to share with us?

Student:
How about a haunted house?

Chiyo:
Okay.

Tomo:
Okay.
That's one haunted house.
Got it.

Chiyo:
So any other ideas?

Chihiro:
I know.
How about a cafe?

Chiyo:
Okay.

Tomo:
All right, cafe.

Chiyo:
Well, does anyone else have an idea?
Any more ideas besides a haunted house or a cafe?
The vote's still open.

Tomo:
Ugh...

Chiyo:
Hm?

Tomo:
Horizontal or vertical...
I... I... I don't know?
What's the first stroke?

Chiyo:
Oh.
Like this.

Chiyo:
If no one has any more ideas, we will take a vote now, okay?
You can vote for either the cafe or the haunted...

Yukari:
No, no.
Going with the standard and orthodox is the death of intellect, Chiyo.
Why not try something out of the ordinary?
For example, you could... Uh... Um...
A cafe is a great idea.

Osaka:
A comment box...

Yomi:
I'm hoping that maybe we'll get some different project ideas by putting the box up.

Osaka:
Different project ideas...
How about just our class setting things up for our very own personal sports fest?

Yomi:
Did you hear what you just said?

Tomo:
Ah, looky here!
The comment box is hungry!

Yomi:
Why don't you stop admiring it and put something in?

Tomo:
Um...

Yomi:
Huh?
Hold on!
What did you just put in there?

Tomo:
Five yen.

Yomi:
You're supposed to put in project ideas.

Tomo:
According to the legend of this comment box...

Yomi:
It doesn't have a legend!

Chiyo:
All right then, now, I would like to discuss our project for the culture fest one more time.
First, we take a look inside the comment box.

Chiyo:
Oh...
Is nothing else in here?
Ah! A piece of paper.

Tomo:
Hm?

Chiyo:
Let's see...
Oh, this idea might be a really good one.
It says, "A Stuffed Animal Exhibit."
"We can put on an exhibit by collecting all the stuffed animals that everyone has and bringing them to school."
"I think this would make the stuffed animals happy as well because they will get to make lots of new friends."
And now you have it.
How does that sound?

Students:
That sounds like a great idea.
That's so cute.
That would be wonderful, wouldn't it?
I can bring ones I won at arcades.

Kaorin:
Hey, hey, who's the one who came up with the idea?

Chiyo:
Let's see...
The person wishes to remain anonymous.

Osaka:
Hey, I know, how 'bout we make some fanciful uniforms and wear 'em at the culture fest?

Kimura:
As a matter of fact, I have a suggestion concerning the very issue.
The key here is the fluffy...

Tomo:
No, thank you!

Chiyo:
We should make a class mascot as well.

Yomi:
How about one big enough to wear?

Tomo:
Good! Good idea!
Let's get together at Chiyo-chan's place and make it!

Kimura:
Oh, also, as you can see, there is this foamy part.
What, that's not the least of it. Furthermore...

Yukari:
Okay, Mr. Kimura, you can leave now!

Kimura:
Wait, please, wait a minute!
Just! Just listen to me for one minute! And I think... Ah!
07-2. Man of Character
Kaorin:
Okay, all set.

Osaka:
You sure my size will fit everybody?

Yomi:
Trust me, it'll be fine.

Chiyo:
I'm going to the store because we're out of juice, okay?

Kaorin:
Sorry for the trouble.

Yomi:
Thank you, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Come on, Mr. Tadakichi, it's time to go.

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Ah, oh...

Chiyo:
Everyone's been waiting a while for you.

Sakaki:
Oh, sorry I was late, Chiyo.
I picked this up.

Chiyo:
Oh, did you bring us juice?
I was just on my way to get some from the store.
Thank you so much, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Hm.

Chiyo:
Huh?
Oh!
My friend here is Mr. Tadakichi.

Sakaki:
Mr. Tadakichi?

Chiyo:
Uh-huh, he's our family's pet dog.

Sakaki:
Is... is it okay for me to pet him?

Chiyo:
Of course!
Mr. Tadakichi is a man of character, so he never gets angry.

Sakaki:
But he's so big, if he did bite it, it'd be no laughing matter.

Chiyo:
Oh, he's perfectly safe.

It's all right, you can go ahead.

Maybe... we should head back.

Sakaki:
Oh, right.

Sakaki:
Although, with him being so big, you could almost ride him.

Chiyo:
Oh, well, actually I can!
See?

Sakaki:
Ah, oh...

Chiyo:
Come on, everyone's waiting, so let's get back.

Sakaki:
O...okay.
So lucky...
Mr. Tadakichi...
So lucky...

07-3. Go With Enthusiasm!
Nyamo:
Well, culture fest season has come once again.
Been a while since ours, but it sure brings back memories, huh?

Yukari:
Hm... Hahaha.

Nyamo:
You don't remember?
At all?

Chiyo:
We had a good turnout.

Chihiro:
Okay, everyone, I need you to put these on.

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki, you look wonderful.

Sakaki:
You... you think so?

Chiyo:
Uh-huh.
It suits you quite nicely.

Osaka:
Hey, how do I look?

Chihiro:
Wow, it's really cute!

Chiyo:
It's incredible!

Tomo:
I don't know!
Well, it's not like it's bad or anything...
But I just don't think you're wearing it that well.

Osaka:
Wearin' it well?

Tomo:
C'mon, let's switch.

Osaka:
Here you go, Tomo.

Tomo:
Got it.

Tomo:
All right, now here I go!
Off, off, off and away
Whee!

Student:
What the?!

Nyamo:
Good morning.
Huh?

What?
What was that?

Yomi:
Hm?
What the...?
Is that...? What tha...? What the...? Is that...? What? What? What?!

Tomo:
Hey, I'm back.
Hah...
I'm so tired.

Chiyo:
Where did you go, Tomo?

Tomo:
Advertising.
I was sprinkling cuteness all over school.

Yomi:
Tough to top of the nice heavy dash of scary.

Tomo:
Ehe.

Student:
Come see the swim team!
We have all kinds of drinks for sale!
You know you're thirsty.

Nyamo:
All right, good work.

Student:
Oh, Miss Kurosawa.

Nyamo:
Tell me, how's it holding up?

Student:
Um, well, the thing is...

Nyamo:
Huh?

Kimura:
What is going on here?

Kagura:
Going on?
What do you mean?

Kimura:
This is inexcusable!

Nyamo:
Something wrong?

Kagura:
Yeah, this guy...

Kimura:
Oh, Miss Kurosawa, I'm so glad you are here.

Nyamo:
Okay.

Kimura:
Please talk to your girls, Miss Kurosawa.
I mean, don't you find it rather odd?
This is a swim team's booth and no one's in a swimsuit!

Kagura, Nyamo:
Um...

Kimura:
Okay, I'll let the swimsuits go.

Nyamo:
Yes, sir.

Kimura:
I think I would like a glass of pool water.

Kagura:
Sir?

Kimura:
Pool water!
As the water from the pool that you girls were swimming in!

Kagura:
What?
We don't have any of that!

Kimura:
Uh...

Nyamo:
Uh...

Come over and take a look!

Osaka:

Um, excuse me, but what are these things?

Sakaki:

Yomi:
Good job, Kaorin.

Kaorin:
Oh, thank you.

Yomi:
Well, then, I guess it's my turn.

Chiyo:
Oh, may I try wearing the costume too?

Kaorin:
All right, you and me trade.

Chiyo:
Okay!

Chiyo:
Uh.. uh... uh..

Kaorin:
It's... it's kinda scary.

Yomi:
Oh, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
What is it?

Yomi, Kaorin:
Ah!

Chiyo:
Did someone call me?

Yomi, Kaorin:
Ahhh!

Chiyo:
Uh.. uh... uh..

Yomi, Kaorin:
Ahhhhhh!

Student:
Oh, wow, it's cute and weird at the same time

Student2:
You're right about the weird part.

Student:
Excuse me, I'd like this one.

Sakaki:
Okay.
Huh?

Sakaki:
You... you wanna buy it?

Student:
Uh-huh.

Sakaki:
You want just the one?

Student:
Yeah, this one.

Sakaki:
Won't you take the cat with you as well?

Huh?

Sakaki:
No way... the dog?

Sakaki:
I wish you happiness.

Chiyo:
Oh, hi, Miss Sakaki.
I'm sorry, but would you please take a quick picture for me?

Sakaki:
Okay, sure thing.

Chiyo:
Okay, thank you.

Sakaki:
Mm-hm.
Okay, Chiyo, say cheese.

Chiyo:
Thank you very much, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Oh, since we're...

Chiyo:
Huh?

Sakaki:
Since we're here, could I also...

Chiyo:
Oh, yeah, of course you can!
Is everybody ready then? Okay, say cheese.

Chiyo:
Okay, I got a photo.

Sakaki:
Thank you, Chiyo.

Chiyo:
Come to think of it, do you have any idea who's in the costume right now?

Sakaki:
Hm?

Kimura:
Hello.

Sakaki:
It's not true!

Chiyo:
Ah, Miss Sakaki!



07-5. Enemy?
Osaka:
Welcome to fairyland!
Welcome to fairyland!
Nyamo:
Now that I think of it, that culture fest we had back when we were in high school, didn't we...

Nyamo:
Have you finally remembered?

Yukari:
<French> Au de cafe <French>.

Nyamo:
You see that, you do remember.

Yukari:
Uh, I got it right.

Nyamo:
Dummy, it's not like this is some kind of quiz.

Yukari:
I don't remember what my students did last year, let alone what I did way back then.

Nyamo:
Don't brag about it.
It's depressing.

Yukari:
Do not be a slave to your past!
You must live in here, the now, this moment!

Nyamo:
Don't go getting drunk on orange juice.

Yukari:
Drunk on youth!

Nyamo:
Yeah, whatever.


Sakaki:
Ah!
Hey, you know what?
I made that kitty myself.

Child:
Huh?

Sakaki:
If you want, you can have it.

Child:
Um...
I don't want it.


Chiyo:
All right, everyone, let's have a toast with juice to celebrate the successful completion of the culture fest!

Tomo:
Here, here!

Everyone:
Here, here!

Yukari:
Good job, people!
Yes, great work, everyone!
Now... let's take... these stuffed animals... and burn them all!

Everyone:
Huh?

Yukari:
What?
You're not gonna burn the animals as a memorial?

Yomi:
Memorial for what?

Tomo:
It looks like we had quite a few visitors.

Chiyo:
Uh-huh, we got a lot of surveys back too.
Plus we sold a bunch of stuffed animals.

Osaka:
No doubt about it.
The stuffed animal exhibit was a huge hit.

Tomo:
Something wrong?
What's up with that sigh there ,Yomi?

Chiyo:
Are you really tired?

Yomi:
Oh, no, it's the end of the day.
Um, well, I sorta felt a twinge of sadness, you know.

Osaka:
I know what you mean.
I wish tomorrow was a culture fest.

Yomi:
I somehow don't think that would be possible, though.

Tomo:
All right, let's have a victory parade!

Osaka:
Yeah!

Chiyo:
Uh...

Yomi:
What's the victory?


Chiyo:
Uh... Mr. Tadakichi...

Chiyo:
The next Azumanga Daioh is all about New Year's dreams.
I wonder what kind of dreams everyone is having?
I like dreams where there's hopping and jumping for joy.
I hope I'll get to have a happy dream.
What? Something red?

Chiyo:
I'm ten years old.

Would you like to fly, Miss Osaka?

Osaka:

Chiyo:
I'll lend them to you... for free.
Well, here you are.

Osaka:
So, I can fly for free with these things?

Pigtails:
Yes, as far as you like.

Osaka:
What?

Chiyo:
Come on! I'm sure that'll look really good on you.

Osaka:
Uh, well, I... that is to say...

Chiyo:
What? You mean you don't want them?
But they're so popular...

Pigtails:
Yeah, what's her deal?

Osaka:
What?

That's it.
Chiyo-chan, she is being controlled by those things!

Pigtails:
Right.
Left.
Turn.
Attention!

Osaka:
Oh...
Hang on Chiyo-chan, I'm coming to save you!

Ah!
Pipin' hot.
Sizzlin'.
Crispy.

I'm sorry, Chiyo-chan!
Her pigtails, I didn't take 'em off right.

It's no good!
I gotta take off and fly somewhere!

Woman:
Ahhhh, somebody help, they rob the bank!

Tomo:
Oh, yeah, ha!

Woman:
And in other news, the heroic Miss Tomo Takino knocked off the bank robbers!

Tomo:
Oh, no, it was nothing, really.

Girl:
Oh, no, my poor little mew-mew is gonna get run over!

Tomo:

Woman:
A heartwarming tale in my very own town!
The super high school girl, Miss Tomo Takino, saves a kitten!

Tomo:
Oh, no, it was nothing, really.

Tomo:
Oh, no, it was nothing, nothing really.
Oh!
Oh, no.
Thank you, but it was nothing really.

Yukari:
Time to pass back yesterday's exams.
And the top score goes to Miss Tomo Takino.

Yukari:
There is nothing more that I can teach you, grasshopper.

Tomo:
Thank you, Master Yukari.

Chiyo:
Ahhh.

Tomo:
Hey, what's wrong, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
I got a big fat zero.

Tomo:
Yeah, well, I got a hundred, but we can still say I lost, you know.

Chiyo:
Thank you Tomo, you're so nice to me.

Tomo:
Oh, I'm not that great.
Here, take a look for yourself.

Chiyo:
Ah! A hundred within a hundred!
You're just too incredible!

Tomo:
Oh, I'm not that great.

Chiyo:
No, Tomo, you're wrong, I'm no match for you.
You're incredible.

Tomo:
Don't be silly, I'm really not.

Yukari:
Miss Mizuhara.
Is Miss Mizuhara absent today?
Come on, Mizuhara!

Tomo, Chiyo:
Hm?

Yukari:
You got a zero. Miss Mizuhara!

Tomo:
Man, you're really hopeless, aren't you?
The teacher's calling for you, get up!

Yomi:
I'm sorry, Tomo...

Tomo:
Don't worry about it.
It's what's friends for.

Yomi:
I want my mom.

Tomo:
Why in the heck?
Why in the heck? Why in the heck? Why in the heck? Why in the heck?
Why in the heck? Why in the heck? Why in the heck? Why in the heck?
Why in the heck? Why in the heck? Why in the heck? Why in the heck?

Miss Sakaki, good morning, Miss Sakaki!

Sakaki:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Over here, over here!
Miss Sakaki, good morning to you!

Sakaki:
Uh, good morning.

Chiyo:
I have a cute little cat that I I'd like to give you, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
But my mother has terrible allergies, so I really couldn't.

Chiyo:
Oh, please!
This cat was abandoned by his owner, so he is in a terrible situation right now.

Sakaki:
Huh?

Chiyo's Dad:
Hello there.

Sakaki:
Oh.


Chiyo's Dad:
Tell me; do you like cats?

Sakaki:
Yes.

Chiyo's Dad:
Did you say that knowing that I am a cat?

Sakaki:
Ah, Yes.


Chiyo's Dad:
Well then, this is goodbye.

Sakaki:
What?! But why?!

Chiyo's Dad:
The truth is, in spite of my appearance, I am not a cat.
I am Chiyo's father.
Thank you for always being so good to my daughter.

Sakaki:
Oh, no.
It was my pleasure.

Chiyo's Dad:
You must go in search of a real cat.
But it will be impossible for you, the way you are now.

Sakaki:
But wait, what should I do?


Chiyo's Dad:
You cannot ask me.
Goodbye.

Sakaki:
Please wait!

08-4. Welcome
Chiyo's Dad:
Oh.

Sakaki:
Oh, I see. Chiyo-chan's place.

Chiyo:
Hi and welcome!
You come inside, won't you?
Please follow me.
I'm home!

Sakaki:
Ah!
Um...hey, Chiyo-chan, there's a...

Chiyo:
Oh, I forgot you haven't met our maid.

Sakaki:
Your maid is a penguin?

Chiyo:
Uh-huh, she does the cleaning and stuff for us.

But sometimes she has a brain freeze while she's working.
Come on, let's get going.

Sakaki:
O...Okay.


Sakaki:
Ah!

Chiyo's Dad:
Hello.

Sakaki:
Okay, now what?

Chiyo's Dad:
A friend of yours?

Chiyo:
Yes! Her name's Miss Sakaki!

Chiyo's Dad:
Welcome then, I am Chiyo's father.
Thank you for always being so good to her.

Sakaki:
Oh, not at all.

Chiyo's Dad:
I know, how about joining us for dinner?

Sakaki:
No, I couldn't.

Chiyo:
Oh, you don't have to be so polite.

Chiyo's Dad:
There will be some red things included, but please don't stand on ceremony.

Sakaki:
Red things?

Chiyo:
Oh!

Chiyo's Dad:
Tell me; what is popular at school these days?

Chiyo:
Let me think. Jane Romeo, I guess.

Chiyo's Dad:
How is Jane?
Is she still single?

Chiyo:
Yeah, her boyfriend dumped the other day.

Chiyo's Dad:
Chiyo, eat your tomatoes.

Chiyo:
Yes, I just love tomatoes!

Chiyo's Dad:
You love or hate isn't the issue.
Eat your tomatoes, Chiyo.

Chiyo:
Mm-hm.

Chiyo's Dad:
How is it? Is it good? Is the tomato good?

Chiyo:
Mmm, it's delicious.

Chiyo's Dad:
They are so red and yet, Chiyo says that they are delicious.

Sakaki:
Oh.

Sakaki:
Excuse me, that thing we were talking about.
Where can I go to find a real cat?

Chiyo's Dad:
A real cat?

Sakaki:
Huh?

Chiyo's Dad:
Are you saying that that I am a fake cat?

Sakaki:
I'm sorry, please forgive me.

Chiyo's Dad:
No, it is not that I am angry. I am not a fake, no.
But do you mean to say that there are cats that are real and ones that are not?!

Sakaki:
Are you sure you are not angry?

Chiyo:
Father, guess what.
It's a visitor!

Chiyo's Dad:
Invite her in, if you would, please.

Chiyo:
Okay.

Osaka:
Hello again.

Chiyo's Dad:
Yes, Hello.

Osaka:
Hello, Miss Sakaki.

Chiyo:
Hey, Sister, come keep us company for a bit!

Kaorin:
Wh... what is everyone doing, Chiyo-chan?

Tomo:
Look, lady, don't you be talking back to our boss!

Yomi:
If you don't do as we tell you...

Osaka:
You're gonna get stunk.

Chiyo:
Ooh, this is really gonna stink.

Tomo:
Ooh, the smell, the smell!

Everyone:
The smell!

Chiyo:
Huh?

Tomo:

Yomi:
Who's that?!

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki!

Sakaki:
Ha!

Sakaki:
Are you all right?

Kaorin:
Uh, yes.

Sakaki:
Oh, no, your knee is bleeding.

Osaka:
A paper fan!

Kaorin:
What?

Sakaki:
Let's hurry to the nurse's office.

Kaorin:
But it's more than enough that you've already rescued me...

Sakaki:
I do anything for you, Kaorin.


Kaorin:
Um... Listen, Miss Sakaki, instead of using the name all my friend use, do you think maybe you can just call me "Kaori"?

Sakaki:
Sure, I understand.

Kaorin:
Uh...

Kaorin,s Mom:
Kaori.
Kaori.
Kaori!

Come on, wake up, Kaori!
Aren't you going to the shrine with your friends for new years?
How long would you play on staying in bed?
And what's with that drooling?
I have to wonder what kind of New Year's dream you had.

Kaorin:
Huh?
Dream?

Kaorin,s Mom:
Come on!
If you don't hurry it up, you're gonna end up being late.

Kaorin:
Continuation!

Kaorin,s Mom:
Just what are you doing?
Come on, now get up!

Kaorin:
No! Continuation!

Kaorin,s Mom:
Don't be silly!
What about your promise to your friends, huh?!

Kaorin:
No! No! Continuation!


Kaorin:
Uh... And I was so close too...

Sakaki:
Happy New Year.

Kaorin:
Hm? Oh, right. Um, a very happy new year to you too!

Uh, uh, uh, horse!

Sakaki:
What?
It's the year of the rabbit.

Kaorin:
Oh, no, a white steed!

Sakaki:
Hm?

Tomo:
Happy New Year!

Chiyo:
Happy New Year to everybody.

Osaka:
Hi, Happy New Year.

Tomo:
Hey, hey, hey, what are you two talking about over year?

Kaorin:
What? Ah...
New Year's dreams...

Chiyo:
Oh, it's too bad, but I didn't get to have a New Year's dream this year.
I wished I had though.

Tomo:
Hey, in speaking of dreams, you showed up in mine, Chiyo-chan.

Osaka:
I had the same thing happen.

Sakaki:
Me too.

Kaorin:
You were also in my dream.

Chiyo:
Really?! That's amazing!
What was I like in your dreams, huh?
Come on, tell me!

Tomo:
Hm...

Osaka:
Um...

Sakaki:
Hm...

Kaorin:
Uh...

Chiyo:
Huh? What's the matter?

Yomi:
Oh, they are over there.
Hm?

Chiyo:
Please you have to tell me!
What was I like?
Please! Please, please! Please! Please!
Won't you please tell me!

Kaorin:
Oh!

-- Preview --

Tomo:
Next time on Azumanga Daioh, it's a Miss Sakaki Special!

Sakaki:
Oh, not really...

Kaorin:
What?! Really?! I'll make sure to watch it!
I'll have to record it for my collection!

Sakaki:
No, see...

Chiyo:
Then, a lot of cute things will be showing up too, won't they?
Like kittens and stuffed animals?

Sakaki:
Yeah, that's right. And father too.

Everyone:
Father?!

Sakaki:
Please watch again next week.

09-1. If I Can't Pet One...
Mihke:
Mew.

Girl:
Mihke!
I'm so happy.
I'm so glad, you see.

Mother:
Did you have fun?

Girl:
Yeah, I liked it, even though I cried a little bit.

Boy:
Hey, Mommy, you know what?

Mother:
No, what?

Boy:
The big girl behind us was crying lots and lots, too.
She cried through the whole movie.

Mother:
The big girl behind us?

Sakaki:
Oh.
Mr. Kitty Cat...

Chihiro:
Wow, they're so cute!

Kaorin:
Aren't they?
And this one playing with a ball of yarn is totally adorable.

Chiyo:
I think they are all adorable.

Osaka:
Uh-huh.
They look so fluffy and soft, it's like they're just two balls of fur.

Chihiro:
I know, I look how peacefully they sleep.

Kaorin:
Oh, Miss Sakaki. Here, you take a look.

Sakaki:
Hm?

Kaorin:
Our cat had kittens.

Sakaki:
Um, if I wanna order copies, do I write it in the back?

Kaorin:
Huh? Do you like cats too, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
Um... a little.

Chiyo:
So, do you have any cats of your own?

Sakaki:
Oh, no. My parents can't handle cats or anything like that.

Kaorin:
Oh, I see then. That's really too bad.


Woman:
Will these photos be all right for you, ma'am?

Sakaki:
I guess.

Woman:
Thank you, please come again!

Sakaki:
Huh!

Chiyo:
Oh....uh...

Sakaki:
Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Hey, where did you get that?

Chiyo:
Well, you see, I won it in a lottery in the shopping district.
Wait a minute while I take it off.
Okay, let me see here...
Uahh.....

I'm sorry for making you carry the costume all this way.

Sakaki:
No, it's okay.


09-2. 11 Years Old
Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
Like for real?

Osaka:
I had no idea.

Chiyo:
Uh-huh, that's right, it really is.

Sakaki:
Morning.

Chiyo:
Oh, hello, Miss Sakaki.
A very good morning to you too!

Tomo:
Good morning.

Yomi:
Good morning.

Osaka:
Good Mornin'.

Sakaki:
You look cheerful.

Yomi:
Oh, we were talking about Chiyo-chan just now.
She has a birthday coming up real soon.

Sakaki:
Your birthday, huh?

Chiyo:
Uh-huh, it's this coming Sunday.
And I'll finally be turning eleven years old.
That means I'll be a little more grown up now!

Sakaki:
Eleven years old...

Tomo:
But just looking at her, you'd swear she was a lot younger than eleven years old, huh.

Chiyo:
Even when I was in grade school, if we were lined up by height, I was always to the front.

Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, please tell me, how did you get to be so tall?

Sakaki:
How... what?

Chiyo:
I wish I could get taller just like you.

Sakaki:
No, being short is better. You're cuter that way.

Chiyo:
Yeah? But being tall makes you like that much cooler.

Sakaki:
Tall is cooler?

Chiyo:
Uh-huh.

Sakaki:
Being cute rather than cool is...

Chiyo:
Huh?

Sakaki:
It's... stronger.

Chiyo:
Stronger?

Tomo:
Speaking of tall, are you still growing, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
Looks that way.

Tomo:
Thought so!
You're even taller than you were this spring, aren't you?
Did you break 170 yet?

Sakaki:
I broke it.

Osaka:
Uah... Uah... Uah...
Chiyo-chan!
That's it.
Miss Sakaki must be suckin' it all away.

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki?
Have you been taking all my height away from me?

Sakaki:
No...

Chiyo:
You took it, didn't you?
You took it, didn't you?
You took it, didn't you?
You took it, didn't you?
You took it, didn't you?!

Sakaki:
Um... no...

Chiyo:
Give it back! Please give it back!

Sakaki:
I didn't...

Chiyo:
Give it back! Give it back!

Sakaki:
I...

Chiyo:
Give it back! Give it back!

Sakaki:
I'm sorry...

Chiyo:
Please give it back!
Give it back! Give it back! Give it back!

Tomo:
Ooh, Miss Sakaki does not have a clue what to do.

Osaka:
Way to go, Chiyo-chan.
Guess that's an eleven-year-old for ya.

Yomi:
Say, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Yes?

Yomi:
You wanna have a party this Sunday?
For your birthday?

Chiyo:
Huh?

Yomi:
We can all get together at your place for the party.
How's that?

Tomo:
I'm in!

Osaka:
Uh-huh, me too.

Sakaki:
Mm-hm, I'll go.

Chiyo:
Really, all of you?
I'm so excited!

Osaka:
We've gotta get presents and stuff and set it all up!

Tomo:
Oh, yeah!

Yomi:
While we're on the subject, what did you get last year?

Chiyo:
Oh, I got ribbons.

Sakaki:
Uh... Ribbons...

Osaka:
Hey, what's the matter, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
Uh, nothing.
Huh...

09-3. Mr. Kitty Cat...
Sakaki:
Uh...

Girl:
Wow, it's so cute!

Sakaki:
Oh...


Woman:
Here you are. That'll be 1,500 yen.

Children:
These are fun!
Can I get one?

Girl:
Here, I've got you one.

Boy:
Thank you.

09-4. Premise
Everyone:
Hello!

Chiyo:
Hello, welcome, everyone.

Everyone:
Thank you for having us over!

Tomo:
Happy birthday, Chiyo-chan!

Osaka:
Happy birthday.

Yomi:
Hi, Chiyo-chan, we brought some presents with us.

Chiyo:
Wow, thank you all so very much!
Well, anyway, please come up to my room.
Oh, hold on. Miss Sakaki?

Miss Sakaki! Miss Sakaki!

Sakaki:
Hm?


Tomo:
All right, ladies, let's begin the super awesome present contest!

Everyone:
Yay!

Tomo:
At the top of the lineup is me.
Here you go.

Chiyo:
Thank you very much.
I can't wait!

What's it supposed to be?

Tomo:
It's my feeling!

What?
You guys didn't like that?
I guess that means I failed, huh.
Fine, have it your way.
Here. This one's the real present I got for you.

Chiyo:
But, what is it?

Tomo:
It's a magic wand!
If you use it, you'll be able to grow tall just like Miss Sakaki!

Chiyo:
Even I'm old enough that I don't believe that stuff anymore.

Tomo:
Oh, come on, come on.

Yomi:
Here you are.
This present is from me.

Chiyo:
Thank you very much, Yomi.
I'm sure I'll love it!

Sakaki:
This one's from me. Here.

Chiyo:
Oh my goodness,
You brought a little stuffed kitten for me?
It's so cute!
Thank you so much, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
You're welcome.

Chiyo:
I wonder what name I should give to it?

Sakaki:
It's Mon Petit.

Chiyo:
Oh, I see, so it already has a name.
I'll take good care of it.

Sakaki:
Now, I want you to give her a good home.

Chiyo:
I'm a little surprised though.
I had no idea you named your stuffed animals too, Miss Sakaki.
It's nice to meet you, Mon Petit.

Sakaki:
Mon Petit...

Chiyo:
Huh?

Sakaki:
Mon Petit is the younger sister.
And she has an older sister.

Chiyo:
Uh...

Osaka:
Speakin' of names, not too long ago, I discovered that a lot of racehorses have real cute-sounded names.

Yomi:
Huh, really?

Osaka:
Yeah, they do.
If I remember a lot, I think some of the names were like "Princess Winy" or "Esprit Ja-ja".

Yomi:
You call those cute?

Osaka:
Why don't you give her a cute name like that?

Chiyo, Sakaki:
Uh...

Sakaki:
No way.

Osaka:
What? But...

Sakaki:
No way.

Osaka:
Oh, well, whatever.
My present is a stuffed animal too.
Here you go.

Chiyo:
Thank you very much, Miss Osaka.
Oh.

Sakaki:
Ah!
That's...

Chiyo:
What?
What's wrong, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
The father...

Chiyo:
Huh?

Sakaki:
This here is the father...

Chiyo:
Do you mean, her father?

Sakaki:
No, yours.

Chiyo:
Mine?

Tomo:
Fine.
So whatever my present didn't make anyone happy or stir up any interesting conversation, it's not like I care.

Oh, Chiyo-chan, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Huh? Yes?
What is it, Tomo?

Tomo:
Chiyo-chan, you're a Giants fan?

Chiyo:
Oh, yeah, this year, the Giants is going all the way.

Tomo:
No way, the Giants are hopeless.
This year is going to Hanshins.

Chiyo:
The Giants!

Tomo:
Hanshins!

Chiyo:
The Giants!

Tomo:
Hanshins!

Chiyo:
The Giants!

Tomo:
No, Hanshins!

Chiyo:
The Giants!

Tomo:
Hanshins!

Chiyo:
The Giants are going to win for sure!

Tomo:
Hanshins!

Umpire
Strike!

Tomo:
You know that's what the Giants say every year and every year they keep losing again.
It'll be the same things this year.
Ah, well, I mean...

Sakaki:
Don't worry.

Chiyo, Tomo:
Huh?

Sakaki:
You have your father.

Chiyo, Tomo:
Huh?

09-5. Why?
Yomi:
Well, we're going now.

Osaka:
It was real fun.

Chiyo:
Oh, I'll come too.

Yomi:
What?

Chiyo:
I'll go with you part of the way.
I have to walk Mr. Tadakichi anyway.

Tomo:
Okay. Then, let's all go together.

Chiyo:
All right.

Oh!
It's a shortcut if we turn here and go down that way.
Tomo:
Why did you stop?

Osaka:
Wow...

Chiyo:
Wow!

Yomi:
Wow, it's so...

Tomo:
So big.

Chiyo:
It's really pretty.

Osaka:
I almost feel like it's drawing me into it.


Chiyo:
Oh, wait!

Wait for me!

Look out!

Miss Sakaki!

Yomi:
See you tomorrow at school!

Osaka:
So long.

Tomo:
Later.

But next time is the second year class shuffle.
With me and Sakaki's class, you can bet there's gonna be some competition.
All right, Sakaki! Now is the time for us to fight it out!
I challenge you!

Sakaki:

Miss Osaka?

Osaka:
It won't be too long now, we're gonna be second years, huh.

Chiyo:
That's right, we're gonna become second year students.

Osaka:
Becomin' second years means the class is gonna get shuffled...

Chiyo:
Oh, I guess that's true!

Osaka:
It'd be nice if I could be in the same class with you again, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
We can! Not just can, We will be!

Osaka:
And Tomo and Yomi and Miss Sakaki too.
It'd be nice if we could be in the same class with them again.

Chiyo:
We can be!
I know we can be in the same class again!

Osaka:
It'd also be nice if Miss Yukari was our homeroom teacher again.

Chiyo:
She can be! She can be!
We'll all be together just like first year.
Huh...

Yukari:
Oh, you don't have to worry about that.

Chiyo, Osaka:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Mi-Miss Yukari?

Yukari:
I'm your homeroom teacher for next year too.

Chiyo:
Huh... Y-You are? Really?

Yukari:
Hey, our class could sure use your fighting power, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Yay! Thank you, Miss Yukari!
All right! All right! Woohoo! Yay! Yay!
Hurray! Hurray!
All right! All right!
Hip hip hurray!


Kaorin:
I'll get to be in the same class with Miss Sakaki next year.
I won't be in the same class.
I will. I won't. I will. I won't. I will.
I-I-I...
Huh?

Yukari, Kaorin:
You will. I will.
You won't. I won't.
You will. I will.
You won't. I won't.
You will. I will.
You won't. I won't.

Kaorin:
I... I won... won... I... won... won... I...

Yukari:
Huh?

Kaorin:
Huh?

Kimura:
We could be together, Kaorin.

Kaorin:
Why'd you guess? Go away!


10-2. Class Shuffle
Tomo:
Woohoo! It's a new school year!
Haaa!
Viva, I like Class Shuffle.
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Kaorin:
Mm...

Chiyo:
It'll be great if we're all together.
Just like how Tomo and Yomi were in the same class since grade school.
Yomi:
Uh.

Chiyo:
I don't have anyone that I've been with since grade school, so I really envy you two.

Tomo:
You being sarcastic?

Chiyo:
Huh?


Chiyo:
I made it!
Look, look, I'm in Miss Yukari's class!

Tomo:
Hey, me too!

Yomi:
Yeah, no way.

Sakaki:
I am too.

Osaka:
Not here...

Chiyo:
We're all here together!

Osaka:
'Cept me.
I ain't here.


Kimura:
Kaorin!


Osaka:
......

Tomo:
It's like she gave you a notice, huh?
Man, Yukari sure is harsh.

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan...

Chiyo:
Don't worry.
You'll make some new friends right away!

Yomi:
Wait a minute.

Tomo:
Spirit in...

Yomi:
I said "wait!"
Wouldn't this Osaka be you?

Osaka
Uh...

Everyone:
Uh...

Osaka:
Wait, do you mean that "Osaka" is me?


Kaorin:
Ah...
Miss Sakaki!

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki, good morning!
We got to be in the same class again.

Sakaki:
Really.

Kaorin:
I'm so exhausted.
Ah, it's her!
Miss Kagura, the all-star sports girl!

Kagura:
Yo.
Guess we're in the same class now.
You know, I've been wanting to have a proper chat with you for some time.
I heard people saying we have a lot in common.
Not that we need anyone to tell us, I'm sure you feel it too...

Sakaki:
...

Kagura:
Huh? Um...
Don't tell me...
You... you don't remember me?

Sakaki:
Mm.

Kagura:
I... I see.
Pht.
Come on, we competed in the sports fest, the marathon, and the other games we played.
You know the one with the ball.
Don't you remember?

Sakaki:
...

Kagura:
You don't remember?
You really don't remember?

Sakaki:
Mm.

Kagura:
Oh, anyway, we're rivals!
I'll be seeing ya!

Sakaki:
Okay.

Kaorin:
Miss Yukari's planning for the sports fest!


10-3. Wolf
Yukari:
Starting today, you are all second year students.
And I'm your homeroom teacher, Yukari Tanizaki.
I hope we have a good year.
Now that I'm looking around, I see that there are quite a few of you here from my first year class.
I wonder why?

Kagura:
Why?

Osaka:
This is my year.
Get it together. Get it together. Get it together.

Yukari:
How could that be?
It's very strange, don't you think?
But just to be clear, it's nothing to do with how remembering new names would be a big pain in the butt.
It's nothing like that, and I also hope everyone keep that in mind.

Oh, and don't change your assigned seats, that goes for the class representatives as well.

Right, now that that's done, class rep, say hello.

Tomo, Chiyo:
Yes, ma'am!

Tomo:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Huh?

Yukari:
Come on, come on, don't worry about it and just come up to the front.

Chiyo:
Yes, ma'am.

Osaka:
Get it together. Get it together. ...

Kagura:
That Chiyo-chan really is cute.
And she isn't well-known for nothing.
Which is more than I can say for our school's well-known wildcat idiot.

Tomo:
Hi, I'm our school's well-known...
Who's an idiot?!
Why you... you a bit of...
You eternally-running-behind-Miss-Sakaki girl!

Kagura:
Yeah, so what?!
There's more brains in that behinds than you have in your head.

Tomo:
How's that? I thought you stuffed them all in your boobs!

Yomi:
Huh... wildcat idiot is right.

Kagura:
At least I have boobs!

Tomo:
You all are boobs!
Oh, check it out!
Come on!

Yukari:
Okay, okay, everyone, let's be nice to each other.
You're all a vital part of our forces.
Okay, now, settle down!

Osaka:
Get it together. Get it together.
Get it together. Get it together.

Kagura:
Hey, Sakaki!
I don't have swimming practice today, so how about you and me walk home together!

Kagura:
Say, Sakaki, I've been wanting to ask you something.
Do you usually play sports and stuff?

Sakaki:
Not really.

Kagura:
Huh.
And you were still that awesome at the sports fest, marathon, and the other games we competed together?
That's amazing.

Are you thinking about joining a club or anything?
I bet the sports things wanna have a few words with you.

Girl1:
Hey, Miss Sakaki!

Girl2:
For you, please!

Girl3:
Join our club, this year!

Sakaki:
Sports clubs aren't my kinda thing.

Kagura:
Wow, classic Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Classic?

Boy1:
Hey there, Miss Sakaki!

Boy2:
Please, on you!

Boy3:
Join our club, this year!

Kagura:
So, Sakaki, how would you feel about maybe joining the swim team?

Well, I guess it is true what they say then.
That you're a silent lone wolf, who doesn't like to hang around big crowds.

Sakaki:
Wolf?

Everyone:
Wow...
Miss Sakaki, please say you'll join our club!


Kagura:
Oh, man, Sakaki, you're playing this way too cool.

Sakaki:
Wolf...

Kagura:
Damn, what am I gonna tell to the swim team's seniors tomorrow?
Hm?
Oh, it's a cat.

Stupid furball!
Ahahaha...
That was great!

Sakaki:
Uh...

10-4. Putting On Senior Airs
Chiyo:
No one understands!

Sakaki:
So, some first years said you were cute?

Chiyo:
Yes!
Miss Osaka and I were walking in the hallway, we were surrounded by first year students.

Girl1:
You must be the famous Chiyo-chan!

Girl2:
You're so small!

Girl3:
And cute!

Chiyo, Osaka:
Uh...

Chiyo:
It was so rude!
I'm a second year student!
And when I told Miss Yomi about it.

Yomi:
Hahaha, of course the first years are gonna be surprised when they see you.

Kagura:
It's okay, Chiyo-chan, all you have to be is cute.

Osaka:
Hehehe...

Tomo:
If you hate it that much, you wanna pin a sign to your chest that says "I'm a second year"?
There!

Chiyo:
None of them know what it's like!
I don't want first year students telling me that I'm cute or that I'm small or that I'm a kid.

Sakaki:
I see.

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, you understand how I feel, don't you?

Sakaki:
Hm...

Girls:
That girl with long hair!
She's just so cool!

Girl1:
She's a second year!

Girl2:
And she's in Class 3!

Girl3:
She's tall!
She totally broke 170!

Girls:
Miss Sakaki is the coolest!

Sakaki:
Huh...

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, you know how I feel, right?

Sakaki:
Sorry, but I'm afraid not.

Chiyo:
No one understands me after all!

Boy:
Huh? What's a kid doing here?
Um...

Chiyo:
You are new to this school, aren't you?

Boy:
Um, well, yeah...

Chiyo:
I am Chiyo Mihama, a second year student.

Boy:
What?

Chiyo:
Senior Mihama to you!

Boy:
Um, okay, Senior Mihama...

Chiyo:
That's right.

Boy:
Uh... S-Senior, huh?


Yomi:
Man, I'm hungry.

Tomo:
Hey.

Yomi:
Yeah?

Tomo:
It never really clicked with me before, but we were first year students until just the other day, right?

Yomi:
Never mind that, just copy the homework.

Tomo:
Oh, we're finally second years.
I feel like I gotta do something second year-ish, you know.

Yomi:
Yeah, yeah, actually done copying.

Tomo:
Ah...

Yomi:
Whoa! Eating early?!
It seems so cheap and petty, but that curry...

Tomo:
When you earned your places as second year high school students, eating lunch early is one of those things that goes way beyond general common knowledge.
It's like the basic of the basics, see?

Tomo:
Thanks for the food!

Chiyo:
Tomo, class is going to start in a minute.

Tomo:
Hah, you can't eat lunch early if you're afraid of class!
Well, of course, perhaps it simply isn't a feat that a mere child could aspire to.
Come on, come on.
Hey, hey, hey, how do you like that?
It's a full hour before lunch period!
Who among you can resist temptation in this world of early lunches galore?


Kimura:
Huh?
Oh, pardon me, I didn't realize it was lunch.

Kimura:
Huh? Huh?
Eleven o'clock?
Ding-dong!

10-5. Marco...
Yukari:
Damn! Almost everybody's gone home!

Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
Whatever.
You guys, come here for a second!

Tomo:
Huh?

Yukari:
You know, I just had to pick this stupid thing up.

Tomo:
Is it gonna explode when we open it?

Yomi:
I don't know if we should open it.
I mean things you pick up off the street can be dangerous.

Yukari:
Well, dangerous would've been better.
Look.

Chiyo:
Haa!

Everyone:
It's a kitten!

Chiyo:
He's so tiny!

Osaka:
He's sleepin'.

Yomi:
Look at the pink nose.

Osaka:
What a tiny bundle.

Tomo:
He's got nasty crud on his eyes!

Yokari:
Okay, one of you have to take this cat home.

Sakaki:
I can see him.

Tomo:
What? He's not gonna stay with you?

Yukari:
No way, I'm too busy, come on!
Look, a tiny kitten like this can't survive all on his own.
Don't you feel sorry for him?

Tomo:
You found him, so you should keep him!

Yukari:
I told you, I'm busy!

Kagura:
What's going on?

Yukari:
Listen, kittens are...
Someone just take him!

Yomi:
That's easy for you to say, but...

Osaka:
I can't do it.

Yomi:
And neither can I.

Tomo:
Yeah, my family's got a dog.

Kagura:
What are we...

Chiyo:
I have Mr. Tadakichi...

Kagura:
Oh, so it's a cat?

Yomi:
Sakaki?

Sakaki:
No, I can't, either.

Yomi:
Oh, man...

Sakaki:
He's curled up into a little ball like a marble, marble, marble calico...
I know, I'll name him Marco for short.

Kagura:
Hey, Sakaki.

Sakaki:
When you think of Marco, there's that story...

Kagura:
Sakaki?

Sakaki:
Could he be traveling 3000 leagues in search of his mother?

Kagura:
Huh?

Sakaki:
Is he going to journey that 12,000km all by himself?

Kagura:
Hello?

Sakaki:
He... he's probably been through a lot of sad and tough times that simply can't be expressed in one or two words.

Kagura:
O...key...

Sakaki:
Be strong, Marco.

Kagura:
Ma... Marco?

Tomo:
Tama!

Everyone:
Tama, Tama!

Tomo:
It's time to chime!

Chiyo:
Oh, what if our class took care of Tama.

Yukari:
As if.

Osaka:
Oh, I see what you were saying.
So, it's someone's duty to take care of him, right?

Sakaki:
Me.

Kagura:
Huh?

Osaka:
That's Chiyo-chan for ya. You're so smart.

Chiyo:
Well, I'll be the pet keeper if there's no one else.

Sakaki:
Me.

Yukari:
No, no! This isn't like keeping goldfish!

Tomo:
All right! It's up to me to help you out!

Yomi:
Oh, yeah?

Tomo:
Yeah, actually I live right next to a pounds.

Yomi:
That doesn't help.

Osaka:
Wow, he's super cute!

Chiyo:
I wanna hold him!

He's just too cute!

Osaka:
Oh, me too.
He's a nice kitty.

Sakaki:
Me... me...

Tomo:
I get him next, okay?

Sakaki:
Careful...

Yomi:
Jeez, Tomo, watching you hold him makes me nervous.
Here, you should hold him gently like this.

Tomo:
Hey, Yomi, no fair.

Yomi:
Do you wanna hold him, Sakaki?

Sakaki:
Mm.

Tomo:
Hey, it's running away!

Yukari:
Don't worry, I just know he'll make it on his own.

Yomi:
That's not what you said two minutes ago!


-- Preview --

Tomo:
Hey, Kagura!
I don't care if Miss Sakaki's rival!
Quit challenging her over and over like a stupid on-trick pony!

Kagura:
Who are you calling stupid!

Tomo:
Well, if you're so smart, then try saying "I'm a big stupid idiot," in another language.

Kagura:
What?
Um... Ich bin ein... super... dumb head.

Tomo:
Dumb head is right.

Kagura:
What did you say?!

11-1. Cosmopolitan City
Kagura:
Huh?
Hey, need any help with your luggage?
Hey!

Shoot! He's a foreigner!
Let's see...
<Spanish?> El helpo lifto... va moi baggo? <Spanish?>

Foreigner:
Eh?

Kagura:
<Spanish?> Me word no comprende? <Spanish?>
<German?> Helfen? Das Help. <German?>
<Spanish?> Helpa mio! <Spanish?>

Boy:
And then, and then, and then...

Foreigner:
<Spanish> xxxxx, Muchas gracias <Spanish>

Kagura:
Huh? Um... Yahoo!

Foreigner:
Uh...

Kagura:
How embarrassing.

Yukari:
I saw you.

Kagura:
Ah!

Yukari:
You did a great job there.
Yahoo! Yeah.

Kagura:
I... I wasn't able to tell what language he spoke.

Yukari:
Well, now, if you'd pay better attention in my class, you could identify and speak with people better.

Kagura:
What would you have done?

Yukari:
Well, ah, the perfect target.
Watch this!

Kagura:
Oh, no way!

Kagura:
Hey!

Yukari:
It's no good! He's German!

Kagura:
Huh?
So, you're just gonna run away?!

Kagura:
So, that's basically what happened yesterday.
It was pretty rough.

Tomo:
Hey, your story reminded me of something.

Kagura:
Oh, yeah, what is that?

Tomo:
Just how very stupid you are, Kagura.

Kagura:
Excuse me!

Sakaki:
Huh?

Tomo:
I didn't know your conversation skill was so lame.
I guess your big chest gets in the way.

Kagura:
My chest has nothing to do with it!
Bit, you could perform under pressure?

Tomo:
Better than you did.

Kagura:
Uh-huh,
Then, how about if I quiz you!

Tomo:
Sure, ask me anything.

Kagura:
What's "I.T." stand for?

Kagura:
Don't look the other way!

Tomo:
It's... it's that thingy.
It's... like e-mail and... homepages and stuff.

Kagura:
Look, I get the general idea.
So, tell me what "I.T." stands for?!

Tomo:
Don't worry about it.

Kagura:
See?! You can't answer!

Tomo:
So... so does that mean that you know the answer?

Kagura:
I'm asking you because I don't know!

Tomo:
Yomi! You tell her what it stands for!

Yomi:
Eh...

Yomi:
In... in...

Kagura, Tomo:
In...?!

Yomi:
Interne... um...
Internet technique...

Kagura, Tomo:
Ooh, I'm convinced.

Yomi:
Really?

Chiyo:
"I.T." is actually short for "Information Technology".
In Japanese, that phrase would be translated to "jouhou gijutsu".
But, I don't know if asking about "IT" is such a good test for judging your communication skills.

Kagura:
Um...

Chiyo:
Yes?

Kagura:
Where do you learn about things like that?

Chiyo:
Huh? Um, well...
Where... what do you...

11-2. Showdown
Kagura:
Morning, Sakaki!

Sakaki:
Mm.

Kagura:
So, what I want most right now out of anything is a mountain bike, you know.
But I'm having a lot of trouble picking up what kind of color and all that stuff.
What is it?

Sakaki:
It's blooming.

Kagura:
Flowers?
Oh, it's hibiscus.

Sakaki:
Pomegranate.

Kagura:
Man, I totally don't know anything about flowers.
Sunflowers and morning glories, that's all.

I know lilies?

Sakaki:
No, gardenias.

Kagura:
Oh, violets!

Sakaki:
Azaleas.

Kagura:
Oh, well, who cares about flowers?
So, anyways, back to the mountain bike.
Huh?

Sakaki:
Hm?

Kagura:
Just now, was that... a contest?!

Sakaki:
What?

Kagura:
A contest for guessing the names of flowers.

Sakaki:
No.

Kagura:
All right.

Kagura:
So, there are a couple of colors I'm really into right now...

Sakaki:
Yeah?


Kagura:
Hey, Sakaki! Let's compete!
Let's have a competition!
This time, the event would be speedy eating lunch.

Sakaki:
Huh?

Kagura:
Okay, ready, set and go!

Huh?
Come on, what're you eating so slow for?

Sakaki:
You should chew your food thoroughly whenever you're eating, you know.

Kagura:
Uh...


Nyamo:
All right, everyone, please split up into teams!

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Kagura:
Okay, Sakaki
Time for us to compete in softball!

Kaorin:
Go for it, Miss Sakaki!

Osaka:
Hit it outta the park!
Homerun all the way!

Um...
How many points is a homerun?

Yomi:
Huh?

Kagura:
Here it comes, Sakaki!

Kagura:
Fly ball to the right!

Chiyo:
I got it! I got it!

Kagura:
Ah!

Chiyo:
Aw...

Kagura:
Chiyo-chan!
Chiyo-chan!

Sakaki:
You okay?

Kagura:
Chiyo-chan, hang in there! Chiyo-chan!

11-3. You Didn't Have to Hit Him
Tomo:
All right!
We're taking physical measurements today!
I'm going with spirit!

Chihiro:
I wonder why Tomo's always so energetic?

Yomi:
Beats me.

Tomo:
My boobs rock!
3 more centimeters, uuuh... all right!

Chihiro:
I'm happy for you, but saying that in public.

Tomo:
But, there's still Miss Sakaki out there to be!
I gotta work hard!

Chihiro:
H-Hey...

Kagura:
Hm?

Kimura:
So, how'd it go?

Kagura:
None... none of your business.

Kimura:
Well, I better be getting to my class now.

Osaka:
Huh?

Tomo:
Hey, it looks like your turn is coming up.
Doesn't it just make you nervous?
After all, what's the one thing you dread preparing for the very most.




Yomi:

I do not prepare for it.

Tomo:
Hm...
A sign for skipping breakfast.
But that's a given.
Eh?

Kagura:
Man, this one's really nice.
Oh, ooh, this one's nice too.

Sakaki:
Ah...

Kagura:
I saved up my New Year's allowance and I've done quite a few part time jobs, so I do have the money.
But it's just that... when it comes down to the buying, decisions are hard to make.
Like color and the shape of it.
The ones I think look nice are expensive.
But I couldn't see myself getting the cheap one.

NecoKoneco:
Meow.

Sakaki:
Just what are you doing?

Kagura:
What? Oh, this?

Hmm... nothing.
I just felt like it.
Although, doesn't it look pretty cool?
Oh, I know.
I'll make this part more like... this!


Sakaki:
It's that cat.

Sakaki:
Ahhhh!

Kagura:
Hey you!
You shouldn't bite people!

Kagura:
Hey, are you okay?

Sakaki:
Huh?
Yeah...

Kagura:
Really? Cats like that need to be disciplined.
You just gotta hit 'em and make 'em understand.

Sakaki:
Yeah, but if...

Kagura:
Huh?

Sakaki:
They'll listen if you just talk.

Kagura:
Yeah right, like hell they will.

11-4. Covered In Cats
Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Sakaki!
Are you going somewhere?

Sakaki:
Yes, I am.

Chiyo:
Uh... Well, um...
See you later then.

Sakaki:
See you later.


Kagura:
Huh?
Awesome. She's got some crazy energy.


Kagura:
Oh, you saw her too?
Yeah, Sakaki was going all out, she was putting all her energy into it that I've ever seen from her.
She was... oh,
Hey, Sakaki.

Chiyo:
Huh?
Oh, Miss Sakaki, welcome back from your... Ah!

Sakaki:
All at once.

11-5. Don't Run Away
Sakaki:
Oh...

Kagura:
What are you doing, Sakaki?

Sakaki:
Aw, aw, aw...

Kagura:
Wow, so do you like get bitten by cats all the time, or just with me?
But you know, I wonder if your hand smells like fish or something?

Sakaki:
Uh.

Kagura:
Okay, I know!
I'll shoo away any cat dumb enough to come near you!

Sakaki:
Uh!

Kagura:
Hey, there's one!

Garrr! Garrr! Garrr!
Haha.

Garrr!
Garrr!
Garrr!
Garrr! Garrr! Garrr!

Sakaki:
Hey, stop it...

Kagura:
Garrr! Garrr!
Garrr! Garrr!

What?
Is something wrong?

Sakaki:
Oh, well, I um... you see...

Kagura:
Huh?

Sakaki:
I can't just keep on... running away.

Kagura:
Uh...

Sakaki:
I have to face it, and then overcome it.

Kagura:
Oh, Sakaki!
Those were great words!
You're so right! Mm-hm.

Oh, there!
Right, now go, Sakaki!

Sakaki:
Aw!

Kagura:
Ah...
Hiya, are you.... are you all right?

She's okay with that?


Girl:
Yeah, it was a real surprise for me.

Kaorin:
Huh?

Girl:
What's up?

Kaorin:
Over there.

Miss Sakaki.
Hey, do you like to play games and things too?

Sakaki:
Ah, yeah.

Kaorin:
So, I guess you play a lot of those one-on-one combat tournament games and high speed racing games, huh?

Sakaki:
Oh, well, sort of.

Kaorin:
Wow, you're amazing, Miss Sakaki.
I'm totally no good at those.
I'd love it if you'd maybe teach me sometime.

Sakaki:
Sure.

Kaorin:
Well, until then.

Sakaki:
Oh.

-- Preview --

Yomi:
Next week is a biography of Chiyo-chan.
Through various people's testimonies, we'll take a look at Chiyo-chan's life, full of ups and downs.

Chiyo:
I've still only lived for eleven years, though.

Yomi:
Eleven years is an epoch.
In order to survive such a trying era, you have to face this society with...

Chiyo:
Um, next time, we'll look at a day in my life...

Yomi:
Rome was not built in one day.
The current Japan is...

Chiyo:
Miss Yomi, what's gotten into you?

Yomi:
Please look forward to it!

12-1. Chiyo-chan's Day
Chiyo:
Huh?
Good morning, Mr. Tadakichi.
This is Mr. Tadakichi.
He is always by my side.
He's been living with us since I was five years old.
When we first met, he and I were about the same size.
But Mr. Tadakichi grew and grew, and finally passed me.
Hm. Smile.
My day begins with preparing my lunch for school.
Asparagus with bacon, salad, and a small omelet to top it all.
Then, I wake up my mother and father.
It's morning!
And eat breakfast.

See you later!
I'm off to school.

It feels good when the weather is nice.
Oh, but my parents bought me a new umbrella, so little rain might not be so bad, either.

Yuka:
Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Uh.

Yuka:
Chiyo-chan!
Long time no see!

Chiyo:
Ah, Miruchi! Yuka!

These are my classmates from grade school, Miruchi and Yuka.

Long time no see.

Yuka:
Wow, is that your high school uniform?

Miruchi:
It's the first time I've seen the summer one.

Chiyo:
It's really cute, huh?
Although, the skirt length is the same for winter as it is for the summer time.

They're in 6th grade, but I'm a second year student in high school.
It's because I skipped forward to the first year of high school when I was in 5th grade.

Oh, yeah! So what's really popular at school right now?

Yuka:
Jump rope!
It's gotten really popular again.

Miruchi:
Mm, and it's pretty fun too. Right?

Yuka:
And everyone can play too.

Chiyo:
Wow, jumping rope! Brings back memories.

Yuka:
What's popular in high school?

Chiyo:
Huh?

Miruchi:
Yuka, Chiyo-chan's in high school now, so she doesn't play anymore.

Yuka:
Oh, you're right.

Chiyo:
We play around in high school too...
But I guess we don't do jump rope.

Sakaki:
Oh.

Chiyo:
See you around.

Miruchi:
Later.

Yuka:
Bye-bye.

Chiyo:
Miruchi and Yuka attend elementary school.
I was attending the same school just a while ago too, but...

Girl1:
We've got swimming today!

Girl2:
Yeah, swimming!

Girl3:
Oh, wait for me!
Wait!

Chiyo:
But... But I am... I am a high school student.

Sakaki:
Morning.

Chiyo:
Oh, good morning, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Those your friends?

Chiyo:
Oh, yes.
They're my classmates from back in grade school.

If we go straight down this road, we get to my high school.


12-2. High School Friends
Chiyo:
They said jump rope is really popular right now in elementary school.

Sakaki:
Oh yeah, jump rope.
It's been a while.

Chiyo:
This is Miss Sakaki from my class.
Miss Sakaki lives in my neighborhood, so I see her a lot on my way to school.

So, did you jump rope too?
Actually, I used to be quite good at it.

Sakaki:
Yeah.
Huh!

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki is big, but quiet.
She really listens to what I say.

Speaking of which, swimming starts today,
I just can't wait.
I want to swim as well as you do, Miss Sakaki...
Huh?!

But every so often, she suddenly disappears.
It's a mystery.

Tomo:
Morning!
How goes it, my friends?

Chiyo:
Good morning.

Tomo:
Hey, Chiyo-chan! Good morning, Yomi!

Chiyo:
This is Tomo and Miss Yomi. Um...

Yomi:
Tomo.

Tomo:
Huh?

Yomi:
Did you catch that show yesterday?
The one I asked you to record.

Tomo:
Oh, shoot! I forgot.

Yomi:
Oh... I knew it.
I was stupid for even asking you.

Tomo:
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stupid!
Stupid! Stu...

Chiyo:
This is the kind of people they are.

Yomi:
You're the stupid one!

Teacher:
Let's move it!
Slacking off is only gonna hurt you.

Kimura:
Um, "shitari" is a form of the sa-column irregular verb, "su."
However, it can sometimes be used as a noun as well,...

Boy:
She still hasn't shown up.

Girl:
Yukari sure likes coming in late.

Boy:
Gotta be a new record.

Tomo:
Is there something going on today?

Yomi:
Who knows? The thing is it's Miss Yukari, she probably just overslept.

Tomo:
No, if I know my Yukari, I'll bet you anything today's the release date of the limited edition box for some video game.

Yomi:
There's a dumb theory.

Tomo:
Yeah, because you're the dumb one, aren't ya?

Sakaki:
How could I...
Huh, if I become one of them...
Oh...

Chiyo:
I'm a kitty cat!

Yukari:
This is not study hall!

Chiyo:
This is our homeroom teacher, Miss Yukari.
She teaches language and grammar.

Yukari:
I just can't believe it!
I was gonna make a quick stop at the gaming store on my way here, but there was this huge line on a weekday!
Probably a bunch of college kids with all kinds of free time.
Honestly! Well, you know I'm late because of them!

Chiyo:
She is a rather unconventional teacher.

Teacher:
Okay! That'd be sure to drink plenty of fluids!

Chiyo:
High school classes are more fun than grade school was.

Yukari:
Now, for this...
Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Yes, ma'am.

Yukari:
Good. Impressive as always.

Chiyo:
Aha.

Chiyo, Yukari:
Huh?

Osaka:
Huh? Um...

Oh, brother.

Yukari:
So, did you sleep well?

Chiyo:
Aha.

Osaka:
No, not very.
Ah! No, that's...
That's not what I...

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka often sleeps during class.
Could she be a night owl?


12-3. Lunch
Kagura:
"At times, he appeared young and energetic,"

Chiyo:
Unlike grade school, in high school, we have a different teacher for every subject.
So, we have all sorts of teachers.

Kagura:
......
"Truly, what one would call a monster passing by."

Kimura:
Okay, you can stop there.
Um, all right, who would be reading next?
Anyone?
Oh, yeah. The other day, I had an opportunity to speak with a teacher from a girls' high school.
If they have P.E. in first hour...
Then they... they apparently don't care whether they wear their P.E. clothes to homeroom too!
And when they have swimming...
Swimsuits!

Boy:
He's serious.

Girl:
He's crying for real.

Chiyo:
We really have all sorts of teachers.

Yes?

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, here.

Chiyo:
Thank you.

Some things haven't changed since grade school.

Yukari:
This time for sure!

Chiyo:
Unlike grade school, there is no school lunch in high school.
So, we either bring our lunch, buy bread at the co-op, or eat at the school cafeteria.

Osaka:
Like the post-war...

Yomi:
We are in the post-war.

Tomo:
Here you go, thanks for waiting!

Osaka:
Welcome back.

Tomo:
Fried noodle's servs all around!

Chiyo:
Wow! Tomo, you're the best!

Tomo:
Here, that's yours, Osaka.

Osaka:
Melon bread...

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
I asked you to get some melon bread...

Tomo:
Hey! Who cares?
Fried noodle's servs are harder to come by.

Chiyo:
Harder to come by?

Yukari:
I forgot my wallet!

Tomo:
They left it open.

Yomi:
Probably because it lets the breeze through.

Chiyo:
Wow...

Chiyo:
The weather is so nice and the breeze feels great too.

Osaka:
Yeah, it does.
Feels like you could fly away if ya just jumped off from the top of here?
Huh? Hm?

Chiyo:
I feel like Miss Osaka might really do things like that.

Tomo:
Hey! Let's eat over here, okay!

Yukari:
Ahhh!!

Damn it, they sold out!

Chiyo:
Eating our lunch on the roof was a perfect idea.

Tomo:
It just tastes better when you eat somewhere up high.

Osaka:
Huh?
What is it?

Chiyo:
Nothing.

Yomi:
Tomo.

Tomo:
Hm?

Yomi:
That serv looks really good.
Why shouldn't you give me a bite?

Tomo:
What?!

Yomi:
Come on now, I always let you look at my homework.

Tomo:
You idiot!
That's my line!

Yomi:
The line belongs to me!

Tomo:
Ha!

Yomi:
Was it good?

Tomo:
Oh, yeah! Really good!

Osaka:
They sure have a lot of energies.

Chiyo:
Tomo and Miss Yomi have been together since grade school, so they always seem to have fun together.
The rooftop feels great.

Yomi:
You are so...

12-4. Afternoon
Nyamo:
Okay, that's it for warm-ups!
Gather around!

Chiyo:
Fourth hour is P.E.
Today, we have swimming.

Nyamo:
Today, we'll swim four 25-meter laps.
And those of you who can't swim can use a kick board, okay?

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Yomi:
So, what are you doing?
You're using a kick board?

Chiyo:
No! Today, I will swim all the way to the middle without one!

Kagura:
You go for it, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Right!

Chiyo:
That's Miss Kagura.

Yomi:
Now, the middle of the pool is a bit deeper, so be careful, okay?

Chiyo:
Right.

Tomo:
Got two!

Kimura:
Uh...

Tomo:
Give it back, now!

Yomi:
You don't need two!

Tomo:
Yes I do too!

Chiyo:
Miss Kagura is a member of the swim team, so she's the best swimmer in the class.
She can even hold her own against the boys.

Wow.

Yomi:
You can do it, go Chiyo!

Chiyo:
Yes! Okay, here I go!

Chiyo:
I've become able to go for about ten meters, freestyle.
In order to go further, I think I'll have to master breathing to the side.
Ah!

Tomo:
Hey, I think I just hit something.

Nyamo:
Ahhh!

Tomo:
Man, sorry about that.
You're so small, I couldn't even see you.

Kagura:
Hey, hey, be more careful.
Chiyo-chan's feet can't reach the bottom.
There is always a risk of death when you go swimming.

Chiyo:
Death?!
I can't wait 'til I grow tall!

Chiyo:
Finally, there's cleaning.
I like cleaning, because everything gets nice and tidy.

Tomo, you can't sweep like that.

I wish she would be more serious.

Huh?
Miss Osaka is serious about cleaning, but she's not very good with a dustpan.

And then, we leave school.
Today was certainly another busy day.

Osaka, Chiyo:
Bye-bye.

Chiyo:
I'm home!

Unlike grade school, high school lets out late.
So, by the time I finish my homework, it's already evening.

Let's go, Mr. Tadakichi.
In the evening, I go for a walk with Mr. Tadakichi.

Oh!

Lately, Miss Sakaki has been joining us on our walks.
It seems Miss Sakaki also likes Mr. Tadakichi.
Taking these walks with the three of us sure is fun.

12-5. Jump Rope
Chiyo:
I know, let's go through the park.

Sakaki:
Mm.

Girl:
Here goes!

Girls:
Ready. One. Two. Three.

Girl:
Four.

Girl:
Oh, Mimi, you messed up!

Girl:
Time to switch.

Girl:
Okay.

Girl:
Oh, it's 5:30 already!

Girl:
I'm gonna be late for cram school!

Girl:
I'll see you later!

Girls:
Bye-bye!

Sakaki:
We're in the middle of our walk, but...

Chiyo:
Huh?

Sakaki:
You wanna play, just for a little bit?

Chiyo:
What?

Sakaki:
Here.

Sakaki, Chiyo:
Little missy, come on in.
Rock, paper, scissors, nobody wins.
If you lose, then go outside.
Little missy, come on in.
Rock, paper, scissors...

Tomo:
And we're tied!

Hey, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
To... Tomo?!

Yomi:
Jump rope, huh?
Brings back memories.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Especially since we don't even get to do it in P.E. anymore.

Chiyo:
Miss Yomi! Miss Osaka!

Osaka:
Know what? I'm here to look for some Tokyo earthworms.

Yomi:
Um, uh, well, I'm not.
Um, I just happened to run into her.

Tomo:
All right! I challenge you!

Yomi:
What do you mean?
You lost already!

Tomo:
It's okay.
You always gotta do three rounds for these kind of things, Yomi.

Yomi:
Is that so?

Tomo:
Here, you take this end.

Yomi:
Okay, okay, fine.

Tomo:
Osaka, hold that end!

Osaka:
What are we singin'?

Yomi:
Whatever Chiyo-chan knows.

Tomo:
Master Chiyo, I challenge you!

Chiyo:
I accept your challenge!


Chiyo:
At night, I get sleepy very quickly.
When I hear everyone talking about late night TV or radio, I envy them a little.
Late nights are no problem once you grow older.
I can't wait to be a grownup.
Mr. Tadakichi, have a good night.

Tomo:
Ahahaha...

Osaka:
Ha...

Kagura:
Hahaha...
Oh...

Chiyo:
Well... Good night.


-- Preview --

Oksaka:
Our version of the great lord of terror is approachin'.
And that is...

Tomo:
Tests! It's tests! Whoa, scary!

Kagura:
Don't worry!
If we work together, there is no summit or summary we can't make.

Osaka:
That's right.
We gotta all work hard together!

Kagura:
Okay! Everyone, fall in step! Here goes!

Knuckleheads:
Tell us what's gonna be on the tests!

Yomi:
Idiots.

13-1. No Guard Strategy
Yukari:
Well that's gonna be it for today's lessons.
But has everybody prepared yet?
Midterms are coming up soon.
It's a tough time for everyone, right?
But even so, it'll be a cinch to get through for the serious boys and girls who've been seriously doing their homework and stuff on a daily basis.

Tomo:
Huh?

Yukari:
But for someone like our Tomo, who copies whole cells from Chiyo, not a chance.

Tomo:
Some of the parts are Yomi.

Yukari:
Shut up, you moron!

Student:
It's so hot again, don't you wish we could have some shaved ice?

Student:
Yeah.

Tomo:
Yomi!

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
We have math this afternoon, right?
I need to see your homework.

Yomi:
Again? Are you serious?
But you just got a warning from Miss Yukari already today.

Tomo:
That's why I decided to ask you instead of Chiyo-chan this time, get it?

Yomi:
Phew...
How about doing your own work sometime?

Tomo:
It's just I didn't catch the assignment.
I really do want to, I swear I do.

Yomi:
Yeah, sure you do.

Tomo:
Here! Next time, as a favor, I'll do your homework as well.

Yomi:
Right.
It'll be riddled with mistakes.
I'll just do it myself.

Tomo:
Then, my only choice is to see yours.

Yomi:
Why don't you just do your own!

Tomo:
It's no big deal. Come on, Yomi, lighten up!
Don't be so uptight about it.
This is you and me, right?

Yomi:
Uh, really.
Well, here.

Tomo:
Ooh, let me have it.
Let me have it now, okay?
Huh?

Yomi:
"Thank you so very much."
Come on!

Tomo:
Huh?
What's that about?
Are you an idiot or what?

Yomi:
The real idiot is you!

Chiyo:
Uh, both of you please, please calm down!

Yomi:
Really.

Chiyo:
Hm.

Tomo:
Idiot.

Chiyo:
Both of you, stop it! Stop!
Please stop fighting!
I said please stop!

Tomo:
It's because Yomi's being stingy.

Yomi:
That is so not the issue here.

Chiyo:
Now, now.
You know...

Tomo:
Hm?

Chiyo:
What Miss Yomi is saying is very true.
You really should try harder.
At least, try before the test date.

Tomo:
It's okay. It's okay. Don't worry.

Chiyo:
What?

Tomo:
I've done nothing this whole time, so there's no point this late in the game.
What will be will be!

Yomi:
That's the kind of person she is, Chiyo-chan.
You're wasting your time even worrying about her.

Chiyo:
Really.

Tomo:
Really, such a problem, isn't it?

Yomi:
We're talking about you, Tomo.

Tomo:
Heh, he, he.

Yomi:
What?

Tomo:
You're really good at taking digs at people.
For real, I'm just no match for ya.
The fruit next door is a fruit that beats on families.
Come on, won't take a dig at me, will you?

Chiyo:
Ah!

Tomo:
You... good job... hitting me with... your left uppercut... uh...

13-2. S
Tomo:
Hey, Yomi!

Yomi:
No!

Tomo:
What the heck?
I haven't even said anything yet.

Yomi:
You're asking me for another favor.
Homework for example?

Tomo:
It's not that.

Yomi:
Then, what is it?

Tomo:
Tell me the scope of the upcoming grammar test.
That's all.

Yomi:
It is a favor.

Tomo:
What can I say?
I forgot what was gonna be on it.

Yomi:
I'll never telling you!
A lazy person like you can just keep forgetting for the rest of her life!

Tomo:
Bu... But Yomi, it just slipped my mind.
I mean...

Osaka:
Forgettin'?
I'll give ya a run for your money any day.

Tomo:
You too, Osaka?
Good job!

Kagura:
Hold it, right there.
Can't have you forgetting about me now, can we?

Tomo:
Ooh, Kagura too!

So, there you have it.
Now please extend your loving help to us three!

Kagura:
Like me for example, I've forgotten the scope of the tests in every single subject, mm-hm.

Tomo:
Ooh, that's quite a dummy.

Osaka:
Oh yeah, by the way...
When is these tests supposed to start again?

Tomo:
Wow! you've even forgotten the schedule?

Kagura:
Oh, man, she is know as the great queen of forgetfulness for nothing.

Yomi:
How can they be so...

Tomo:
So, in conclusion...

Yomi:
What?

Tomo, Kagura, Osaka:
Tell us the scope of the next test, right now!

Yomi:
Hm!

Kagura:
Tell us!

Osaka:
Tell us!

Tomo:
Tell us!

Kagura:
The scope of the tests!

Osaka:
Yomi!

Tomo:
Tell us!

Kagura:
Please!

Osaka:
Help us!

Tomo:
Yomi!

Kagura:
The tests!

Osaka:
The tests!

Tomo:
You have to!

Kagura:
Please!

Yomi:
Think again, like hell I'm gonna tell some knuckleheads like you?!

Tomo:
Knu.... knuckleheads?! What?!

Tomo:
Hm?
Hey, what are you guys acting so cool for?

Kagura, Osaka:
Huh?

Tomo:
Come on, you two, say something back at her.

Kagura, Osaka:
Huh?
Knucklehead.

Tomo:
Knucklehead"S"!

Kagura, Osaka:
Oh!
Who're you calling knuckleheads?!

Yomi:
Hm, phew.

Tomo:
Fine, then!
If you wanna go that far, then we just won't ask you.
If we can't find out the scope, then we'll just have to study everything.
That's right.
We three will work together.
Just you watch!
We'll get the last laugh.

Tomo, Kagura, Osaka:
On our honor as knuckleheads!

Kagura:
I don't get this part.

Osaka:
What could it mean?

Tomo:
We can't lose hearts.
We'll figure it out if we work together.


Kagura:
Hey, why don't we make a sincerely apology to Yomi and get her to tell us the scope of the exams.

Tomo:
If we lose, we'll have lost!

Kagura:
Uh...

Osaka:
Say.

Kagura:
Huh?

Osaka:
Like for "Blue Three", would that mean that "Blue" is his last name?

Kagura:
That was random.

Tomo:
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
Osaka, that's so dumb!
"Blue Three" is a foreigner, isn't he?

Osaka:
Mm-hm.

Tomo:
That means his last name's gotta be "Three."

Kagura:
Uh...

Kagura, Osaka:
Ooh!

Kagura:
I never knew that!
You're awesome, Tomo!

Tomo:
Yeah, I know.

Osaka:
Okay, but I wonder what happened to "One" and "Two."

Osaka:
You know, I guess that means "Blue Five" or thereabouts would be Jackie Chan, huh?

Tomo, Kagura:
Oh!

13-3. Exams
Kagura:
I understand that it's no use if there're just us knuckleheads now.

Sakaki:
What?

Kagura:
I know there's a big test coming up tomorrow.
And I also know I'd better do something about it.
But unfortunately, I never managed to take any notes in class and I'm in pain for it.
So, here's the thing, Sakaki.
Please, oh, please, can I take a quick little peek at your notes?

Wow, thank you!
Looks like having a rival can come in pretty handy, huh?
Thanks a million!

Kagura:
All right, now which should I copy first from this thing?

Don't get it...
Don't get it...
Don't get it.

Don't get it...
Umm, don't get it.
Don't get it!

Don't get it. Don't get it. Don't get it.

Hm?
What the heck is this?
One of Sakaki's doodles?
Not much of an artist, is she.

Hey, Sakaki.
Thanks a lot.
Though just looking at it, it didn't tell me as much as I thought it would, you know?
Later.

Sakaki:
Ah.

Osaka:
Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
Huh?
What is it, Osaka?

Osaka:
I've got a question.

Yukari:
Oh, wow. I guess when tests roll around, even Osaka has an interest in studying.
All right, ask me anything.

Osaka:
Well, in America...

Yukari:
Yeah.

Osaka:
Like with American homes...

Yukari:
Yeah?

Osaka:
You can go inside with your shoes on?

Yukari:
Yeah.

Osaka:
Okay, so, what if you...
...you stepped in dog poop like out there in the street,

Yukari:
Ugh..

Osaka:
...and then you just went in home without realizin' it...

Yukari:
Ughhh..

Osaka:
And then on top of that, if the American father and mother and eldest son and eldest daughter all stepped on poop themselves and they went in home without realizin' it...

Yomi:
You're rather relaxed?

Tomo:
Huh?

Yomi:
Isn't there something you should be doing, Tomo?
The test is tomorrow, you know.

Tomo:
Ha. Hm. Ahahahaha.
I have a secret plan!
Feast your eyes!

Yomi:
What are those?

Tomo:
Hmm... my picks.

Yomi:
Your picks?

Tomo:
I've covered the whole board.

Yomi:
This is your plan?

Tomo:
As they say, there's no telling how the future will turn out.

Yomi:
Is that so?

Tomo:
I'm not gonna let myself get worked up about it anymore, 'cause I've got it all covered now.

Yomi:
I'm glad to hear it.

Tomo:
Of course, you are.
And is everyone else gonna be okay?

Oh, my, here's someone putting up a futile resistance.
Oh, what to do?
Cramming for the night before?
Can you memorize it all in time?

Student:
Shut up! You're gonna make me forget!

Tomo:
Yeah, yeah, don't take it out on me.

I bring glad tidings for everyone.
Tomo's prediction of "what's on the test!"

Like for example, the text on page 32, we're gonna be translating for sure.
Don't forget to memorize it all!

Yukari:
All right, everyone, you may begin.

Students:
It's not on here!

Yukari:
What? What?

Yomi:
Huh....

13-4. Formation
Kagura:
Hm... 30 points, huh?
Well. this test was pretty hard.
Looks like it's gonna shape up to be a really low-scoring competition.
Hm?

Kagura:
Hey, Saka...

Sakaki:
Hm?

Kagura:
Oh, wha...
Never mind. It was nothing.

Kagura:
I had no idea Sakaki was that smart.
I guess it really must've been a lucky day or something.
That's it! That's gotta be the reason why!

Chihiro:
Kaorin, how many points did you get on the test?

Kaorin:
This time I got 85.

Chihiro:
That's good, I only got 80 points.

Kaorin:
But it seems like this test was pretty easy though.

Chihiro:
I know, I'll bet the average score's gonna be pretty high.
That kinda sucks.

Kaorin:
Yeah.

Kagura:
This test was pretty easy...
High average score...
That means everyone got good scores...
So, this could... possibly be... really bad, huh?

Tomo:
Hey, Osaka!
How'd you do?

Osaka:
Oh, not so good.

Tomo:
Yeah, well. There was no way it was gonna be.

Osaka:
Hah...

Tomo:
All right, ready? One, two...

Tomo, Osaka:
Three!

Tomo:
Oh, man, I lost with 31 points!

Osaka:
I did it! 42 points!

Tomo:
Damn, to think I'd lose to Osaka...

Osaka:
That's good, huh.

Kagura:
Yay! Go, knuckleheads!

Tomo:
What are you calling yourself a knucklehead for?

Kagura:
Yeah, well...

Tomo:
So?

Kagura:
Yes?

Tomo:
So, how many points did you get, huh?
Don't tell me you're gonna brag to us how good you did?

Kagura:
30 points here.

Tomo:
That's just insane.
What's up with that?! It's worse than my score!
I got, what was it, 31 points, right.
Yeah, that's right.

Kagura:
Wow, I lost! Well, damn it!

Tomo:
That just pissed me off for some reason.

Kagura:
Yeah, really?

Osaka:
Hey, wait!
Does that mean, then now I'm the leader of the Knuckleheads 'cause I got the highest score out of all of us.

Tomo:
I'm not quite sure you're leader material.

Kagura:
And that doesn't make me envy you.

Osaka:
What? Really?

Tomo:
Hey, besides, in Knuckleheads, wouldn't you think the lower score would be like greater anyway?

Osaka:
Oh.

Kagura:
What... what's with that look?!

Osaka:
Our leader!

Tomo:
We'll follow you for the rest of our lives!

Kagura:
H-H-Hey, now, wait a minute. I don't wanna do this, okay?!

Osaka, Tomo:
Our leader!

Kagura:
Besides, 30 points, 31 points, I mean, how much of difference is there?

Tomo:
Hah-hah! A win is a win, even by one point.

Kagura:
Oh, man, that is so not cute!

Tomo:
Oh, well, I'm confident that I'm at least cuter than you are.

Kagura:
You're really pissing me off.

Tomo:
Oh, am I?

Yomi:
Oh, hey, how many points did you get, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
So, tell me how did you do, Miss Yomi?

Yomi:
Oh, I guess I did all right.

Chiyo:
Well, then, let's show each other on the count of three.

Yomi:
Okay. Ready, one, two, three!

Chiyo:
Hahaha...

Yomi:
Wow! A hundred!
I'm no match.
Not with my measly 92 points.
Damn it. I really thought that I had you this time, well...

Chiyo:
I think it just went really well for me this time around.

Hmm? Uh... Uh-oh...

Osaka:
42 points!

Kagura:
30 points!

Tomo:
31 points!

Kagura, Tomo, Osaka:
By our three scores combined, we have 103!
Ha-ha-ha-ha.
The Knuckleheads win!
We ain't knuckleheads no more!

Yomi:
Whatever...


13-5. Abilities
Tomo:
I realize this is sudden, but the knuckleheads will be disbanded as of today!
Why you ask? It's very simple.
I will no longer be knucklehead one.

Everyone:
Huh?

Tomo:
Yes, I have found a way to do it.
Hahaha...
And that is... to steal the abilities of Chiyo-chan and Miss Sakaki!

Chiyo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Yes! I'll take Miss Sakaki's athletic power and Chiyo-chan's abilities as a prodigy!
It'll be perfect!
No one will call me a knucklehead after that!

Yomi:
Wow, I don't know where to start poking fun.

Osaka:
You... you know what?

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
While you're at it, you can have my ability to be late and my ability to forget everything.

Tomo:
No! I've gained extra, unnecessary abilities!

Chiyo:
Wait, so what happens then, huh?

Tomo:
Well, I'll tell you.

Yukari:
And so, in this situation, the construction after the "if"...

Tomo:
Good morning! Hello, Miss Yukari.
I'm late! And I'm very sorry!

Yukari:
Oh, well, just get to your seat.

Tomo:
Right! Hah!

Chiyo:
Ah!

Yomi:
Ah!

Kagura:
Ah!

Osaka:
Ah!

Tomo:
The answer to that part is "a delightful little breeze"!
Oops, I'm sorry, I forgot my textbook!

Tomo:
That's what'll happen.
See what I mean?
It got all screwed up because of the Osaka abilities.
And I was going pretty good until then too.

Osaka:
Oh, sorry about that.

Yomi:
Well, you know, if you don't fix your tendency of relying on other people, you're never gonna get anywhere.
And it won't just be tests like this one.
We're taking entrance exams next year.

Tomo:
I don't know.

Yomi:
I do!

Tomo:
Well, I'm sure it'll work out. Hahahaha...

Kagura:
Seriously, Tomo.
I really wonder how you got into this school.

Tomo:
Huh? I'm not quite sure I understand exactly what you mean by that, Kagura.

Kagura:
Really?

Tomo:
Maybe you should try another language, like French.
<French>Oui, oui!<French>

Kagura:
Um...
<French> Tu es... <French> um...
<French?> Tu es... stupid <French?>

Tomo:
<French> Pardonnez moi? <French>

Kagura:
How did you even get in this school when you're so stupid!

Tomo:
Stupid, huh?
You can't even say school in French.
Besides, that goes for you as well.
Or if Miss France prefers "tu"... "also"...

Yomi:
You mean <French> aussi <French>.

Kagura:
I hate to say it, but you're exactly right!

Tomo:
Yes, I am.
And that's what makes you my rival.

Kagura:
Huh?

Yomi:
Hello?

Tomo:
Which pretty much means that even though we both've been saddled with a big disadvantage, fact is, we're still here anyway.
So could that mean we'll get through the entrance exams if we just keep doing what we're doing?

Chiyo:
Uh...

Yomi:
Hm?

Kagura:
Oh!

Yomi:
Tomo was like that all the way through the second year of middle school.
But in the third year, she suddenly decided to take up studying.

Tomo:
Yup! Up until then, I hadn't done any studying whatsoever!
All my textbooks were as good as new.

Yomi:
Oh, that's impressive.

Tomo:
And you got into our school? That's amazing.
I guess you can do stuff if you try.

Tomo:
Something like that.
It was when I heard Yomi was trying to get in.

Chiyo:
You did it because you wanted to go to the same school as her?

Yomi:
No, that wasn't it.

Tomo:
See, the thing is, when I said I'd try to,
Yomi said... "Hah! With your grades, it'll be impossible, Tomo."
So, I studied like a maniac after that.
When the results came back and Yomi learned I'd gotten in and you should've seen the look on her face!
It was great!
So, if I really feel like doing something, I can totally do it.
Now, everyone, shower me with your lavish admiration!
Huh?

Kagura:
Hey, why do you always work so hard at doing things that other people don't like?

Tomo:
What do you mean?

Yomi:
Well, that's just how she is.
She's been like that since grade school.

Tomo:
You... you make it sound like I did something bad!

Yomi:
Get a clue.

Tomo:
What?!


-- Preview --


Yukari:
Okay, everyone, time to study!
We're having a big study group meeting at Chiyo-chan's summer home!

Tomo:
What? Study?
I'm gonna smash watermelons on the beach again!

Yukari:
This time, I was thinking of having Miss Minamo Kurosawa as a guest speaker to give an adult lecture.

Osaka:
An adult lecture?

Chiyo:
What kind of lecture is that?

Yukari:
Nyamo, I'll leave the rest to you.

Nyamo:
What? What am I giving a lecture on!

Everyone:
Ooh! Tell us now!

14-1. Shopping
Osaka:
What? Goin' to your summer home again this year?

Chiyo:
Yeah. So, I thought I would invite everybody to come to the house with me.

Osaka:
That sounds great! I'll go.

Yomi:
That's next week, right? Okay, got it.

Chiyo:
There's gonna be a festival going on over there, so please bring your summer kimono with you.

Kagura:
If it's next week, the team's taking a break, so I can go.

Kaorin:
Next week is the week of the Astronomy Club camp...

Chiyo:
That's too bad.
I'll invite you again some other time.

Sakaki:
You invited me to come along with you?

Chiyo:
Yes, please, please, please, please say you'll come!

Tomo:
What?! You're hitting your beach house again this year?!

Chiyo:
Yes. So, I thought we could all go together like last time...

Tomo:
Are you bragging?! You're bragging, aren't you?!
Oh, classic!
Maybe you're thinking of enjoying a nice bourgeois summer all by yourself, but I'm not gonna let you, damn it!
Take me with you! Come on! Take me with you!

Chiyo:
W-Well, that's why I was calling you in the first place, Tomo.

Tomo:
Oh, then that's fine.

Chiyo:
All right, let's see, I think I've called everyone now.

Chiyo:
Yes, Mihama residence.

Yukari:
Hello? Hey, it's me.

Chiyo:
Ah, M-Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
So, we're all getting together at your place, right?
9:30 sharp. Don't be late, okay?

Chiyo:
Uh...
How did she know about it?


Chiyo:
Oh.

Osaka:
Hey, Chiyo-chan, where're you goin'?

Chiyo:
Shopping, to get ready for the trip to our summer home.

Osaka:
Oh, that's a good idea.
Think I can come shopping with you then?

Chiyo:
Certainly. You wanna hop on?

Osaka:
Sure.

Chiyo:
Well, here we go.

Osaka:
Go ahead.

Osaka:
Maybe I should drive this time.

Chiyo:
That might be good.

Osaka:
Here we go.

Chiyo:
Okay.

It seems riding in tandem really isn't safe.

Osaka:
It sure isn't.

Tomo:
Yo! What's up you two? You're out shopping?

Chiyo:
Yes, actually we are.

Tomo:
Yeah, I'm buying too! A super cool swimsuit!

Osaka:
For your upcomin' beach house trip?

Tomo:
Yeah.

Osaka:
So, what kind?

Tomo:
Hm, one-pieces are nice, but I think I'll have to go with a bikini.
A really sexy one!
And for the color I'll... What's the... Um...

Osaka:
Oh, man, my hands are really full and I can't keep up!

Tomo:
You don't have to take every single one.

Osaka:
You say that, but it's kinda hard to refuse them.

Chiyo:
Yeah, almost impossible.

Tomo:
You just have to ignore them.
Keep from making eye contact and...
I said, don't take any!

Osaka:
But they are all just so polite.

Tomo:
How many are you gonna accept?
I mean you're never gonna use all of that anyway so...
You're giving them away now?!

I'm off to the swimsuits.

Chiyo:
Well, shall we go on over to the outdoor goods section and see what we can find there?

Osaka:
Yeah, let's go.

Good. Oh, no good...
Okay, this time...
Oh, no way...
Right, one more time...

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka!
Miss Osaka, are you okay?!
Wha? Wha?

Osaka:
This is an escalator.

Chiyo:
This way, it'll be easy to get on, right?

Osaka:
This is an es... um... elevator.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka:
I get mixed up sometimes.
Elevator and escalator. Escalator and elevator?

Chiyo:
Oh, really?

Osaka:
I know it! I do know which one is which, Chiyo-chan!
Don't you make fun of me.
So, the box-shaped one is an escalator.
But that's where I get all mixed up and...
Um... lemme think...

Chiyo:
Well, the box-shaped one is an elevator.

Osaka:
Yeah, yeah, I know that!

14-2. Meeting Up
Chiyo:
Wow!
It's the perfect weather for going on a trip!
I better get ready before they start arriving.
Oh, coming!

Sakaki:
Morning.

Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Sakaki, you're here already?
There's still another hour before everyone's supposed to get here.

Sakaki:
Yeah. I'll just wait. With Mr. Tadakichi.

Yomi:
Hey, Chiyo-chan, I finally made it.

Chiyo:
Oh, okay!

Osaka:
I didn't get lost this time.

Chiyo:
I'm so glad!

Yukari:
Oh, look, hey you guys!

Nyamo
Is everyone here?

Chiyo:
Tomo and Miss Kagura should be coming too.

Sakaki:
Hah... what bliss.

Tomo:
Morning! I'm here and I'm not late!

Chiyo:
Hey, welcome you two!

Kagura:
Man, your house is something else, Chiyo-chan.
I guess you'd call it a mansion?

Tomo:
How about it?! Isn't it awesome?!

Kagura:
Yeah, it is pretty awesome.

Tomo:
Isn't it? Yeah, I know.

Kagura:
Just what exactly are you so proud of?

Osaka:
Hey, Kagura, you've gotten totally tanned.

Kagura:
Yeah, it's 'cause I'm on the swim team.

Osaka:
It makes you look like someone who plays it real loose.
Like some kinda playgirl.

Kagura:
I-I really look like that?

Chiyo:
I suppose so.
There was a group of boys back in grade school who looked like that and played outside all the time.

Osaka:
Nah, it's a different kinda playin' than that kind.(xxx)

Chiyo:
Huh?


Yukari:
Ooh! So, this is our ride for this year's trip!
Chiyo-chan, you are so thoughtful.
You went ahead and got a car ready that can fit everybody.

Chiyo:
I asked my father and he would rent it for us.

Yukari:
I'm impressed. What a good girl.

Nyamo:
Yukari, come here a sec.

Yukari:
Sure thing.

Yomi:
A countermeasure for the Yukari-mobile?
Way to go, Chiyo-chan.

Tomo:
Yukari really is clueless, huh.

Kagura:
So, what is this "Yukari-mobile" thing?

Tomo:
See, Chiyo-chan rode in it last year and was deeply psychologically scared for life.

Kagura:
Mmm... Was it that bad, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Oh, no. Nyaow'm(now I'm) completely fine.

Kagura:
Nyaow?
Does... does she speed or something?

Chiyo:
She doesn't speed that much, but there're times she goes too fast and other times, incredibly slow.
Miss Yukari really should check her sides more often, and her behind.
Please Miss Yukari, Please look behind you too.
And sometimes, I get the feeling she doesn't even see the traffic lights or pedestrians.

Kagura:
So, basically she's totally no good at it?

Yomi, Tomo:
Mm-hm.

Yukari:
All right!

Yomi, Tomo:
Huh?

Yukari:
I'm driving!
Everyone, hop on board!

Yomi, Tomo:
What?!

Yukari:
Uh...


Kaorin:
If only there weren't any club activities, I could be at the beach with Miss Sakaki right now...

Kimura:
But I'm here!

Kaorin:
Why on earth are you here?!


Chiyo:
We're here!

Kagura:
Hey, so this is Chiyo-chan's summer home, huh?
Not bad, not bad at all.

Tomo:
Isn't it? Isn't it?!

Kagura:
Okay, but why are you so proud of it?
That's what I wanna know.

14-3. The Ocean!
Chiyo:
Okay, then, I'll open the door now.
If I were to lose this key right now, we wouldn't be able to get inside the house!

Tomo:
Iyaaahhh!

Everyone:
Uhhhh...

Tomo:
I did it.

Yomi:
But what the hell for?!

Tomo:
When you hear things like that, it just makes you wanna do it, you know?

Yomi:
You still should not throw a key, Tomo.

Osaka:
I don't see it.

Chiyo:
So many mosquitoes here.

Yukari:
Sheesh, haven't you guys found it yet?
What's the deal?

Nyamo:
Hey, you should be helping out too!

Tomo:
Hey, you know...

Yomi:
What is it?

Tomo:
If I like to find the key and threw it again, it'd be totally hilarious!

Yomi:
No, it would not!

Osaka:
Don't see it...

Chiyo:
All right, I found it!

Yomi:
Sakaki!

Tomo:
Ah!

Yomi:
Now! Go and unlock the door!

Chiyo:
Yes!

Tomo:
Damn you! No fair!
Taking me on three-to-one!

Yomi:
I need you to shut up!

Chiyo:
Oh, I'm worried about the rest of the trip.

Osaka:
Hah... Here at last.

Kagura:
Wow, it's nice inside too.

Tomo:
Now that we're inside after all that hard work, it feels especially good, huh?

Yomi:
Would you please keep your mouth shut?

Chiyo:
All right, after we get a little rest, let's go out to the ocean!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Girl:
There!

Boy:
Got it!

Girl:
Hahaha.

Boy:
All right!

Girl:
Take that!

Tomo:
The ocean!
And just like last year, that means watermelon smashing!

Chiyo:
And we were able to bring a bat this year.

Tomo:
Just you wait!
This year, with this lethal right hand, the despicable watermelon will be...
Huh? Ah!

Kagura:
I did it!
Split right in half!
Huh?

Tomo:
What have you done?

Kagura:
What?

Tomo:
I was gonna smash it...
Hey, I was gonna freaking smash it!

Kagura:
Man, don't cry.

Yomi:
I'm gonna go buy juice.
Any takers?

Chiyo:
Me! Cola, please!

Yukari:
Beer, please!

Nyamo:
Don't ask for that!

Osaka:
Oh, yeah, me too!
I want orange juice!

Sakaki:
Oolong tea.

Yomi:
Okay, I'll be back in a bit.

Yomi:
Thanks for waiting.
Now, who wanted the orange juice again?


Yukari:
Say.

Nyamo:
What?

Yukari:
The raw ham with a melon, it's one of those tie-in products, right?

Nyamo:
Better than the sweet and sour pork with pineapple?

Yukari:
Oh, that's true.

Chiyo:
Wow, so, what is that you're making?

Sakaki:
Neco Coneco.

Chiyo:
Oh...

Sakaki:
Do you think the ears are a little too small?

Osaka:
I'm back!

Yomi:
Hey, Osaka, the orange juice is yours, right?

Osaka:
Oh, that's right.

Sakaki:
Sorry...

14-4. Capture Operation
Tomo:
Night time!
Night time is the right time to party!
We'll drink and we'll sing!

Chiyo:
No, no, we have the summer festival before that.
I told you there'd be one nearby.
Don't you remember?

Tomo:
You know what?
I think she's right!
Yeah, it's goldfish time!
I'll catch all of them and release them into the sea!

Sakaki:
That... That would...

Nyamo:
Okay, girls, get your summer kimonos.
We all set?

Everyone:
Yeah!

Osaka:
Miss Kurosawa, how do we put these on?

Nyamo:
Huh?
Um... um...

Chiyo:
Oh, I can put kimonos on!

Sakaki:
So can I.

Nyamo:
Oh, well then, could you maybe teach the rest of us?

Yukari:
You're useless, Nyamo.
An adult who asked to learn how to put on a kimono from a kid?

Nyamo:
Hey, you don't know, either!

Yomi:
But it's a little unexpected.

Tomo:
Yeah, Yukari whatever, but I figured Nyamo could hack it.

Nyamo:
Nyamo, is it?

Yukari:
Well, it is true.
It isn't very like Miss Kurosawa, who is so good at putting ties on other people, wouldn't you say?

Nyamo:
Hm!

Everyone:
What?!

Tomo:
Wouldn't you learn to do that, Nyamo?!

Yukari:
Long ago, back when Nyamo was all lovey-dovey, this woman used to practice on me every day knotting and straightening neckties!
Oh, yes.

Everyone:
Wow.

Nyamo:
Who... who cares?!
It was a long time ago!

Yukari:
Well, it ended up that the fruit of those practice sessions were never put to good use.
However, she moved onto a new ambition!

Nyamo:
Ah! Stop!
What is with you?!
Maybe you've forgotten what happened that summer three years ago!

Yukari:
With that Nyamo, can I tell them all about that one thing you hid in your closet four years ago?!

Nyamo:
Say what....?

Tomo:
Ooh, they're hitting at each other's old wounds!

Chiyo:
Okay, is everyone ready?

Everyone:
Yeah!

Chiyo:
Then, let's go!

Kagura:
I haven't worn a summer kimono in like, a really long time.

Chiyo:
Really, Miss Kagura?
So, is that kimono you're wearing a new one?

Kagura:
Yeah. I asked my parents if they had any summer kimonos and my dad got real happy and then he bought me this one.

Tomo:
Hey, hey, hey, did you do that thing, where you pull the sash and twirl around, huh?

Tomo:
Oh, come on! Come on! Come on!
Oh, please little lady.

Chiyo:
You mustn't, Lord Magistrate!

Tomo:
I call it the "Oh Please Little Lady Game."

Kagura:
Um, I don't think so.

Tomo:
Huh?
That's what I did when I got my summer kimono.

Kagura:
What's sort of family?

Tomo:
Octopus balls, fried squids, candied apples!
I'm gonna eat, eat, eat everything I can!
I'll even try that lot drawing you can never win!
Ooh, I wanna do the useless yo-yo balloon fishing, too!

Yomi:
Don't try to do it all just because you see it.

Chiyo:
Oh.

Osaka:
Oh, it's turtle scooping.

Chiyo:
They're cute, aren't they?

Man:
300 yen a pop!

Chiyo:
Oh, what do you think I should do?

Osaka:
Well, when you think 'bout it rationally, you don't really need turtles, huh.

Man:
Uh...

Osaka:
Sure are cute though.

Chiyo:
Yes, they are.

Man:
Uh...

Woman:
It's ten shots for 200 yen.

Kagura:
Oh, do it, Sakaki! Fire!
Oh, a little more to the right!
Ooh, so close!
Hey, you hit it!

Woman:
Here you go. Congratulations.

Kagura:
Awesome, you did it, Sakaki!
You totally shot down the Neco Coneco!

Sakaki:
Huh?

Kagura
You hunter, you! You crazy sniper!

Sakaki:
It's not dead, it's not dead!

14-5. The Adult World
Nyamo:
Okay, listen everyone, it's almost time for lights out, all right.

Tomo:
What are you talking about?
The night's still young!

Yomi:
No, at times like this, if you go to sleep early and get up early, the day will feel longer and it'll feel more like you've profited.

Tomo:
Ooh, looks like Four-Eyes might actually have a point there!

Yomi:
Four-Eyes, huh?

Tomo:
But they do say that getting staying up late is the best part of traveling and...
Oh, she's plotting to sleep early, so she alone can profit from it!
Unforgivable!

Yomi:
No, Tomo, she is 11 years old.

Tomo:
Shut your mouth!
I'll handle this!

Chiyo:
Ah, ah!

Tomo:
Hahahaha...

Kagura:
Man, You're mean.

Nyamo:
Okay, let's everyone go to sleep now, shall we?

Yukari:
Now, now, wait a minute, Nyamo.
What's wrong with letting them have one day of freedom?

Tomo:
That's our Yukarin!
You sure are understanding!

Nyamo:
Well, I suppose.
It'll be okay.

Tomo:
Yeah! Hurray for Nyamo!
Now, let's have a toast!

Yukari:
You're not allowed to have that!
Honestly, Tomo, where the heck did you get this?
Well, what's done is done.
I guess I'll just have to dispose of it all myself.

Nyamo:
No, you will not!

Yukari:
Hey!
Oh, that's okay.
I actually brought some sake with me!

Nyamo:
You shouldn't be doing that!

Nyamo:
If I let Yukari drink it all, it'll be a big mess...
I'll have to take it upon myself and drink it!

Everyone:
Cheers!

Nyamo:
Ahaha...
I mean, like who cares about guys?!
What's wrong with being single?!

Yukari:
Oh jeez, it's gotten to her.

Tomo:
Well, this seems like fun in its own way.

Nyamo:
In the end, being single is the best!
Hahaha.

Kagura:
Um, really?

Osaka:
I wonder if she's okay?

Chiyo:
I don't think so.

Nyamo:
Shut up! I'm an adult, you know.

Tomo:
I have a question.

Nyamo:
What is it, Tomo?

Tomo:
When it comes to adult relationships, is it all like pervy and stuff?

Nyamo:
Yeah, it's pervy and then some!

Tomo:
Ooh! Like what?!

Nyamo:
Well, for example...

Chiyo:
What? Hey, um...
What did that just mean?

Osaka:
Shh.
Be quiet and listen.
You'll understand it when you grow up.

Chiyo:
Uh...

Nyamo:
My head hurts. But why on earth...?
Oh, Miss Sakaki, good morning... huh?

Chiyo:
Oh, good morning.
Are you all right, Miss Kurosawa?

Nyamo:
Wh-What do you mean?

Chiyo:
Oh, um, Miss Kurosawa, I have a question for you.

Nyamo:
Wh-What is it?

Nyamo:
Mmm... Ah...

Chiyo:
I don't get it.
Could you explain it to me?

Nyamo:
Chiyo-chan, where on earth did you learn about all that?!

Yukari:
You. From you. Uh-huh.

Everyone:
Oh! Miss Kurosawa, good morning to you!

Nyamo:
Huh?

Yomi:
I really wanted to thank you for last night.

Tomo:
It was extremely educational!

Osaka:
Miss Kurosawa, I admire you.

Kagura:
I can't thank you enough, Coach.

Nyamo:
What? What's this all about, huh?
Yukari.

Yukari:
Haha.

Nyamo:
Huh...
Hey! What in the world did I do last night?!
Come on, tell me!


-- Preview --

Yukari:
It's coming up on the second year for the sports fest!
We'll win this year, too!
We'll win, no matter what!

Tomo:
Yukari, you only care about winning against Class 2, right?

Yukari:
Your dreams should be big and boundless.
Our ultimate goal is victory.
Victory, I tell you.

Yomi:
Ooh, she sounds awfully serious this year.

Tomo:
Please tell me, there's food involved?

Yukari:
Ahaha.
You'll have to wait until after you've won to find out!
Watch us against next time!

Yomi:
I knew it.

15-1. Members of the Kimura Family
Yukari:
The time is once again upon us!
The sports fest is tomorrow!
We must beat Class 2 no matter what!

Kagura:
Class 2?

Tomo:
So, that's Nyamo's class, right?

Osaka:
Oh...

Kagura:
So...

Yukari:
Work hard, do your best, and seize the victory.
Is that not a beautiful goal?
That's 10,000 yen worth of beauty! It'll be precise.

Tomo:
Oh! Oh!
If we beat Class 2, we should get juice even if we are not first place!

Yukari:
Non, non, non. Such lowly ambitions simply will not do.
Aim for victory!
If you are victorious, I'll buy drinks for everyone.
Maybe some steak.

Osaka:
That'd be nice
Some steak.

Kagura:
What?

Osaka:
But super spicy sauce is no good.
I can't handle spicy food.

Kagura:
I see.
So, what does steak have to do with the sports fest?

Osaka:
Cayenne is actually a type of red chili pepper.
Did you know that?

Yukari:
Hey, you two slackers!
Do you guys have the will to win?!
Especially you, Kagura!

Kagura:
Huh?

Yukari:
Do you know why you're sitting in this class right now?!

Yomi, Kaorin:
So, that really was the reason...

Yukari:
Now, let's see you put some spirit into it!
Down with Class 2!
To victory! Go Class 3!

Everyone:
Go Class 3...

Yukari:
Not enough spirit!
One more time! Go Class 3!

Everyone:
Go Class 3!

Nyamo:
Well, I'll take attendance now.


Yomi:
She's really into this.
So, steak again, is it?

Osaka:
Well, that's if we win, right?

Chiyo:
With Miss Kagura and Miss Sakaki, our class will be really strong this year,

Tomo:
We've also got some people that drag us down.

Yomi:
You're the one who drags us down!

Tomo:
What do you mean?
Didn't you see my many accomplishments last year?!

Yomi:
Yeah, I did.
I saw you trip magnificently at the finish line and take out the runners behind you.
That great accomplishment that made such a great big mess.

Tomo:
So what?!
Can't you at the very least appreciate my fantastic showmanship?!

Chiyo:
Uh, um, please sign me up for fewer events this year.

Osaka:
And why are we doing 10km marathon, anyway?
Couldn't there be a bread-eatin' contest?

Tomo:
It's true!
I tripped on purpose, okay?!

Yomi:
Don't worry. Chiyo-chan.
You're definitely a vital part of our team.
What kind of outfit do you think we should make for the cheering contest?

Kimura:
Well, I have a suggestion concerning that.

Everyone:
Ah!

Osaka:
Oh!

Kimura:
This time, this wonderful baton is the key point so I...

Yomi:
Hm!

Kimura:
Ah...

Tomo:
Huh? What's this?
It's a photo of a woman.

Osaka:
She's a real pretty lady.

Tomo:
Who is it?

Kimura:
My wife.

Everyone:
No way!

Tomo:
Someone like that...
This is a joke, right?
Uh...

Kimura:
What are you talking about?
I have a photo of all of us together.

Tomo:
So, uh, who's the little girl?

Kimura:
That's my daughter.

Tomo:
She seems like a very intelligent child...

Yomi:
Weird.

Osaka:
Yeah.

Tomo:
Any way you look at it, that wife for Kimura is just plain weird!

Yomi:
Definitely.

Chiyo:
Hey, you guys, that's terrible!
It's true that he's an odd teacher, but...

Osaka:
I smell some sorta conspiracy.

Tomo:
Yeah, there's insufficient motive for her to have chosen Kimura.

Chiyo:
That's probably just her taste in men...

Osaka:
That wife's got awful taste.

Tomo:
Oh, I know!
Maybe his wife's got a real bad personality.
And that's the reason why...

Yukari:
No! Believe it or not, his wife is supposedly so kind, she can tolerate THAT.

Tomo:
Does... does that mean that she's an angel?

15-2. Did You See? Did You See?
Osaka:
It did turn out clear today.

Yomi:
What's the matter?
You don't look too happy.
I thought you were looking forward to running in the obstacle course race this year.

Osaka:
Oh, that's fine.
But it ain't the issue at hand.

Chiyo:
Issue at hand?

Osaka:
Yeah, it's a real big issue too.
When it comes to marathons, I'm no good.

Chiyo:
You mean that 10km marathon we have to do?
I've been despairing over that one as well.

Yomi:
Not good at it?
Then, is there anything you are good at, Osaka?

Osaka:
Um... Yeah, puzzles...

Yomi, Chiyo:
Huh...

Osaka:
I lied. I'm no good at puzzles either.

Yomi:
Don't tell half-baked jokes like that.

Osaka:
Oh, I hate it.

Yomi:
Why not try and think of it as like a diet.

Osaka:
Oh, maybe that would work.

Yomi:
Say for example, you never go running long distances on your own.
Well, this is your chance.

Osaka:
That's a good point, but I'm not fat.

Yomi:
Wait, you only said that you weren't?

Osaka:
Uh...
Just thinkin' 'bout the obstacle course, I can't wait!

Kagura:
Yeah, I'm gonna do my best today!

Tomo:
That's right.
Do your best. Do your very best!

Kagura:
What's with the attitude, huh?!

Tomo:
It's quite simple, Kagura.
The harder you work and the faster you run, the more likely Yukari is treating me to juice, right?
So, you just go out there and do your best for me!
Hahaha.

Kagura:
Damn it...

Yomi:
They're so incredibly simple.


Kimura:
FIRST PLACE! Hurray!

Announce:
And that was the message from the Executive Sports Fest Committee Chairman.

Announce:
We will now be starting the basket scramble.

Chiyo:
I didn't get a single ball in last year, but I will get one today.

Tomo:
I didn't get any in last year either, but I'm gonna get three this time!

Chiyo:
Ooh.

Osaka:
Hey, I wasn't able to score any baskets either last year, but this year, I'll put in five!

Chiyo, Tomo:
Ooh!

Tomo:
Well, in that case, I'll get three more for a total of six!

Chiyo:
I wanna get in at least two as well.

Kagura:
We can't count on these guys.
So, let's do our best, okay?

Nyamo:
Ready?!

Tomo:
Take that!

Osaka:
Take that!

Chiyo:
There!

Tomo:
Take that!

Osaka:
Take that!

Chiyo:
There!

Tomo:
Take that!

Osaka:
Take that!

Chiyo:
There!

Ah, I did it! I did it!
The ball went in! My ball went in the basket just now!
Did you see?! Did you see, you guys?!

Tomo:
Take that!

Osaka:
Take that!

Tomo:
There!

Osaka:
Take that!

Tomo:
And that!

Osaka:
Take that!

Tomo:
And that!

Chiyo:
There!


Announce:
Next up is ball rolling.

Tomo:
Tomo-Chiyo pair, let's go all the way!

Chiyo:
Yeah!

Nyamo:
Ready?!

Announce:
Next up is the obstacle course race.

Osaka:
I'll go do my best for y'all!

Tomo:
Isn't having Osaka do the obstacle course race a really bad case of miscasting?

Nyamo:
Ready?!

Yomi:
Well, she kept saying how she just really wanted to do it, so...
You know where you stick your face in the flour to get the candy?
She said she wanted to do that.

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Here goes!

15-3. Unidentified Wife
Chiyo:
Here, Miss Osaka.
Please wipe your face.

Yomi:
So why's that gotta be the four of us now?

Osaka:
Hahaha.

Announce:
Next up is the girls' cavalry race.

Tomo:
Rock, paper...

Everyone:
Scissors!

Osaka:
Scissors.

Tomo:
All right!
Tomo takes the victory!

Yomi:
That round should've been called invalid 'cause somebody was late.

Tomo:
Come on!
Who on earth puts in late just to lose?
Right, Osaka?

Osaka:
You are good at rock-paper-scissors, Tomo.

Yomi:
It's the worst possible setup!

Tomo:
All right! Crush the enemy!

Chiyo:
Tomo, please quit moving!

Nyamo:
Ready?!

Tomo:
A varsity scally ranks, raise the anchor!
We're taking the field too!

Yomi:
Chiyo-chan, are you okay?

Chiyo:
I... I'm okay... F-Fine...

Tomo:
Okay, go right!
Move to the right! The right! The right!

Osaka:
Right?

Yomi:
The hand you hold your chopsticks in!

Osaka:
Um... let's see...
So, it's this one, huh?

Yomi:
If you've figured it out, put your hands back!
Chiyo-chan won't last long!

Chiyo:
I can't hold on...

Tomo:
Idiot Chiyo!
Where's your spirit?!

Yomi:
You're the idiot!

Tomo:
What?! Taking-digs four-eyes!
I'm the captain!
Anyone who dares to defy me can leave this ship now!

Yomi:
How is it you want me to?

Girl1:
So what now?

Girl2:
I kinda feel sorry for them, you know?

Girl3:
Yeah.

Tomo:
Why aren't you freaking moving?!

Girl4:
And they're... a little scary.

Girl1:
Do you guys wanna go somewhere else?

Girls:
Oh!

Yomi:
Chiyo-chan, are you okay?

Chiyo:
Oh, more or less

Tomo:
Ah! You... you're drinking juice!

Yomi:
You have to replenish the fluid you've lost.

Tomo:
The juice is for when we win and Yukari treats us to, you Moron!

Yomi:
We have to drink something.
We can't hold off until the sports fest is over, you know.

Tomo:
Water!
You can drink water until then!

Yomi:
You can do that.

Tomo:
Damn it!

Yomi:
What's the matter?
Was the tap water not so good?

Yomi
That's mine, you know!

Tomo:
Now, hold on.
Take a look at that.

Yomi:
At that?

Tomo:
Uh-huh.

Yomi:
Wait, that... could be... Kimura's wife?

Tomo:
Yeah.

Yomi:
She really exists...

Tomo:
Let's see just how good a person she is.

Yomi:
What are you doing?

Tomo:
Doing this.

Kimura's wife:
What's that?
Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear, ow!

Tomo:
Whoa!
She's like a super good person!

Kimura's wife:
Hahaha.

Tomo, Yomi, Chiyo:
Uh...

Chiyo:
Oh, she's coming towards us.

Yomi:
Yeah...

Kimura's wife:
Oh, my goodness!
You must be Chiyo-chan.
Wow, you are such a cute one!

Chiyo:
Um, how did you know who I am?

Kimura's wife:
Oh, I'm sorry.
My husband's one of the teachers.
And he'd told me that there's this cute, tiny, little girl who goes to school here.

Chiyo:
I... I didn't know he'd mention me.

Tomo:
So, did you come today to watch the sports fest?

Kimura's wife:
Yes, I had intent on coming in earlier, but I was working so hard at making this lunch, so I came in late.

Tomo:
A lunch from a loving wife!

Kimura's wife:
Oh, stop it.
Though, you know, he likes to call it his "love wife lunch box".

Yomi:
Love wife?!

Tomo:
Why that?!
It just sounds so wrong!

Tomo:
So, what about Ki... um, Mr. Kimura do you like, huh?

Chiyo:
Ah!

Kimura's wife:
Um... let's see... I think he's cool.

Everyone:
Huh?

Tomo:
She has no eye for character!

Kimura's wife:
Well, it's true he isn't really the type that's in fashion these days.
But you know what?
It's a little like how 70s clothing has been making a comeback.
He sort of cycles around again like that.
Maybe I'm just outta touch with the present days.

Tomo:
Yeah, right!
It doesn't matter how many cycles we go through, Kimura's turn is never gonna come up!


15-4. Nervous Wreck
Announce:
Next up is the scavenger race.

Nyamo
Ready!

Osaka:
You can do it, Chiyo-chan! Yeah!

Yukari:
Do for steak!

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, hang in there!

Tomo:
Beat them up!
Make it so they'll never be able to get up again!

Yomi:
What in a scavenger race?
Beat up who?

Tomo:
Go!

Osaka:
Uh, here she comes.

Chiyo:
O-Okay...

Yomi:
Glasses again?

Chiyo:
N-No, um, well, well...

Tomo:
Oh!
Is it bloomers?!
You want mine?

Chiyo:
Oh!

Yomi:
I kinda doubt it.

Chiyo:
You come with me!

Tomo:
Gotcha!

Yomi:
What? Tomo...
No way!

Osaka:
Yeah, it was bloomers.

Yomi:
Chiyo-chan sure has guts pulling that moo.

Tomo:
Goal!

Tomo:
Hey, Chiyo, so, what were you supposed to pick up?
A beautiful lady?
Or maybe someone you admire?
Or your best friend?
Oh, I'm turning red!

Chiyo:
Ah... Ah!

Tomo:
What the heck?


Kaorin:
What?!
Chihiro just twisted her ankle?!

Yomi:
Yeah, she's at the nurse's office now.

Kaorin:
What am I gonna do?
She and I are doing the three-legged race.

Yukari:
What's that?
Are we short someone?

Kaorin:
Yeah, I'm missing my partner for the three-legged race...

Yukari:
Well, then, it'd be nice to get someone strong to replace her.

Tomo:
Me!

Yukari:
Hey, Sakaki!
Come and be in the three-legged race.

Kaorin:
Oh...
B-But, for Miss Sakaki to take part in such a dull event...

Sakaki:
No, not at all.
Really,
I've always wanted to try out the three-legged race.
It looks kinda fun.

Kaorin:
Ah, honestly?
Are you sure?

Sakaki:
Let's do this.

Kaorin:
Yeah, let's do our best together!

Chihiro:
Kaorin! Kaorin!
If you want I can actually run with you.
The nurse told me it wasn't that bad!

Kaorin:
Agrh!

Chihiro:
Um...

Kaorin:
Agrh!

Chihiro:
Good... good luck, okay?

Announce:
Next up is the three-legged race.

Kaorin:
Um, well, um... I'll do my best, okay?

Sakaki:
Right.

Kaorin:
And I'll die doing my best if I have to.

Sakaki:
Uh, okay.

Kaorin:
I'll die! I'll just die!

Nyamo:
Ready?!

Sakaki:
Right, let's do our best.

Kaorin:
Yes!

Sakaki, Kaorin:
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two...

Kaorin:
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two.
One, two. One, two. One, two. One, two...

Sakaki:
One, two. One, two. One, two, One, two.
One, two. One...

Kaorin:
Ah! Hahaha!

We did it! Miss Sakaki!
We got first place!

Sakaki:
Yeah.

Kaorin:
Of course, please take this flag as a thank you, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
No, that's okay.

Kaorin:
Then what should I... um...
Oh, I know!
What do you think of... uh, uh, uh...

Sakaki:
Well, it's very... um...

It's too tied.

Kaorin:
If you can't untie it then, maybe we shouldn't try to force it.

Sakaki:
Well, we can't exactly leave it.

Kaorin:
Oh, if it's about me, please don't worry.

Sakaki:
Huh?

Kaorin:
I-I'll be fine. Honest.

Sakaki:
You'll be fine, huh?
15-5. The Numbers Are In
Announce:
The final event will be the school wide 10k marathon.

Tomo:
All right!
I'll see our big victory with this!

Chiyo:
I'll aim to finish the race.

Tomo:
Idiot Chiyo!
Such a lowly ambition is no good!

Chiyo:
What? It's no good?

Tomo:
That's right!
Now, watch how I run!
How I live on, Chiyo-chan!

Osaka:
Oh, I guess the dreaded hour has finally come 'round, hasn't it?
The time I spent out on that fun obstacle course race is now but a distant memory of the damp and cloudy past.
No! Super fun obstacle course race, please come back!
Come back! You've gotta come back! I miss you obstacle course!

Yomi:
Please let me lose the extra weight from this month's taiyaki pastries.
I will lose it!

Kimura's wife:
Good luck, everybody!

Nyamo:
Ready?!

Tomo:
Full stretch! Oh, yeah!

Kagura:
Huh?
What the?

Yukari:
Go, Tomo!
Freak-away victory!
That steak will be mine.

Girl:
Hang in there, everyone!
Good luck!

Osaka:
Oh, it's Tomo.

Tomo:
If I can't finish first anyway, I figured I'd at least be first towards the beginning.
So, I was totally in the lead at the 1 km mark.
And I did get to shine for that one brief moment, so there.

Chiyo:
Th-That's so cool, Tomo.
So, that's how you live, huh?!
Okay, me, too!

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan!

Tome:
Well, hey there, welcome back, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
I... I cannot follow this way of life...

Tomo:
I whole-heartedly agree.

Chiyo:
I came in last.

Osaka:
Second to last.

Chiyo:
Oh, thank you very much.
So, Miss Sakaki, what place did you get?
I bet you came in first, huh?

Sakaki:
Oh, No, I'm not good at distance, so I came in sixth.

Chiyo:
Oh, but sixth is still really good!

Kagura:
Hey, ask me what my place was!

Chiyo:
Okay, where did you place, Miss Kagura?

Kagura:
It was this!

Osaka:
Flat?

Kagura:
Fifth! Dummy!

Tomo:
Fifth, huh? And sixth?
I beat you all on the first kilometer!
This contest here is a tie!

Osaka:
Oh, I see.

Kagura:
There's nothing to see!

Announce:
The scores have been tallied for the final event, the marathon.

Kimura:
Attention!
The first place goes to...

Everyone:
Yeah!

Tomo:
Yukari, juice me!

Yukari:
Nyamo...
Victory!

Nyamo:
It's too bad.
But everyone you've worked really hard.

Yukari:
First place!

Nyamo:
Okay, for your efforts, I'm treating you all!

Students:
Yeah!

Yukari:
What's with you?
Acting so happy when you lost.
Ah! Loser team!
Look at me, losers!

Everyone:
Uh...

Yukari:
Loser team!
Aren't you ashamed?!
I'll bet you are!
You people are on the loser team!
Losers! Losers!
Loser team! Loser team!

Tomo:
My juice.

Yomi:
You still want it?

Tomo:
No...


Yomi:
Damn it!



-- Preview --


Tomo:
Next week is the culture fest!

Kaorin:
There's lots of cosplay, lots of fan service!

Chihiro:
Special costumes one after the other.
120 percent cuteness!

Osaka:
There'll be lots of 'em, like the plaster wall and bamboo umbrella monsters.

Tomo:
That's not exactly what you'd call cosplay...

Osaka:
Then how 'bout octopus ball and Japanese pizzas?

Tomo:
I think you're even further off than before.

Osaka:
In that case, homerun!

Tomo:
Say what?

16-1. Combinations
Chiyo:
The culture fest will be coming up soon.
So, what should we do for this year's culture fest?

Student1:
A cafe!

Student2:
A haunted house!

Chiyo:
Those things again? Um...
Well... Um...

Yukari:
Okay, I'm fine with whatever.
You know, that whole respecting the students' independence thingy.

Student:
School's out!

Yomi:
Back to the comment box, huh?

Chiyo:
The only ideas so far are for the cafe and the haunted house, so...

Yomi:
No 5-yen coins this time.

Tomo:
Oh, I know!
How about we combine the two and do a haunted house cafe?!
When people are having tea and stuff, we'll go "Boo!" and scare them.
A cafe where you can't have tea in peace.
This could be it!
A breakthrough idea?!

Yomi:
It sounds like lunch time in grade school.

Osaka:
Well, it just might be a good idea.

Tomo:
Wahoo!

Osaka:
Maybe.

Yomi:
Really, now?

Osaka:
Huh... surprise!
Here ya are, drinkin' coffee, when you discover a cockroach inside.
Whoa! Hey, lady, what's goin' on here?!

Yomi:
That's not really what a haunted house is about.

Chiyo:
What if the waitresses are all dressed up as different kinds of monsters?

Tomo:
Yeah, that would fit the theme, but you are never gonna scare anyone.

Chiyo:
Is it no good if people don't get scared?

Tomo:
Not really.

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, you'll be a plaster wall.

Chiyo:
A plaster wall? Why, Miss Osaka?

Osaka:
Do it.

Yomi, Tomo:
It might be cute.

Chiyo:
Here, one milk tea coming right up.

Osaka:
Uh...

Tomo:
What other monsters are there?

Yomi:
Let's see...
That umbrella one?

Osaka:
No good!
I see a major structural flaw with the haunted house cafe!

Tomo:
What?!

Osaka:
Oh, I got it! I sure belt a home run!

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Instead of a cafe that's like a haunted house, how 'bout we do a haunted house that's like a cafe?

Tomo:
See... Um... that would be...

Chiyo:
A home run?

Yomi:
Well, this is the culture festival, so I'd like to do something that'll set us apart from other classes.

Tomo:
Yes, that's it!
Let's do something the other classes could never hope to imitate.
Something we have that nobody else does...

Osaka:
Huh...

Yomi:
Something this class has that nobody else does, huh?
You mean something like Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Hm... Oh! Ooh! Hah!

Yomi:
So did you think of something?

Tomo:
The Chiyo-chan Show!
All of us will become Chiyo-chan!

Yomi:
Become Chiyo-chan?!

Tomo:
Exactly!
We could put up our hair like this...
Hi, my name is Chiyo. I'm a little genius.
I always make hundreds.
And I'm really rich too.

Yomi:
Oh, she's getting pissed off now.

Tomo:
Oh, yeah?
My name is Chiyo.

Chiyo:
No, I am not like that, no way!

Tomo:
Not like that, no way?

Kagura:
A culture fest project?

Osaka:
You know I've always wanted a chance at doing a cafe.

Kagura:
But aren't there usually a whole lot of classes that wanna do the cafe thing?

Osaka:
Yeah, that's right.
From what I hear, there's a whole lot of haunted houses and cafes.
And that's why we gotta come up with a really good plan.

Kagura:
Uh-huh.
Oh! How about we put the two together and make a haunted cafe, huh?!
That would be a killer idea!

Osaka:
Ooh, the same wavelength.

Tomo:
Uh...

Kagura:
Same as what?


16-2. Epiphany
Kagura:
Hey, hey, didn't your class had that fanciful cute thing going on last year?

Chiyo:
Yes, it was very well received.

Kagura:
Yeah, that was pretty good, so why don't we combine that with something?

Chiyo:
Oh, I see what you mean.

Osaka:
I get it.
We'll have a cute haunted house.

Kagura:
No, not like that.

Yomi:
A stuffed animal cafe?

Chiyo:
We could improve on what we learned from last year and come up with something good.

Osaka:
Come-from-behind home-run!

Yomi:
Not again!

Osaka:
We can just lump all of it together and set up a cafe with like scary monsters of cute animals.

Yomi:
Okay, I don't even know what you're saying anymore.

Chiyo:
And it's not a come-from-behind home-run, you know.

Osaka:
In other words, let me explain it.

Yomi:
I didn't ask.

Osaka:
Well, you see there'll be lots of cats and dogs inside the cafe...
And they'll all be dead.

Everyone:
Uh...

Osaka:
It'll be good to keep it all together.
Or we still might use this right away, so maybe puttin' it over here will be better.
Although at the same time, if there's just one in a separate spot, it might be forgotten.
Oh, but the simple convenience of havin' it over here might actually end up being more advantageous in the long run.

Yomi:
Hey, what's the deal with all the useless activity going on over here?

Osaka:
Huh?

Student:
What should I do here?!

Chiyo:
Please put that chair all the way to the far side!
That desk needs to be in front of the wall!
Oh, please hold on that!
Go borrow a panel from somebody first, okay!
No, not there!
Please put it in the hallway!
You need to cut the paper for the menu to a uniform size!
Please transport the foodstuffs according to the type of food!
Oh! We're not gonna make it!
Somebody, turn back the clock before it's too late!

Osaka:
Oh, I can't quite reach it.

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, please do some work!

Tomo:
What are you doing?

Sakaki:
Designing.

Tomo:
Here, let me borrow it for a second.

Sakaki:
Uh...

Chiyo:
Is this the box?
No, it's not.

Kaorin:
Huh?

Chihiro:
What's the matter, Kaorin?

Chiyo:
Oh, we might not make it in time!

Kaorin:
Um, Miss Sakaki, is there anything that I can help you with?

Sakaki:
Hm?

Kaorin:
Oh, you're drawing a design?
So, what is it then, huh?

Sakaki:
A hat.

Tomo:
Hey, Miss Sakaki! Come here for a sec!

Sakaki:
Excuse me.

Kaorin:
Go right ahead.
Oh, well...

Chihiro:
What are you doing, Kaorin?

Kaorin:
I was just talking to Miss Sakaki!

Chihiro:
What's this?

Kaorin:
It's a hat.

Chiyo:
Ah, we're gonna run out of time!

Tomo:
I cannot let you take the Earth, you villain!
Hiss!
Hiss, hiss, hiss, hiss! Whoosh!
Whoa! You have the power to fly?!
Then I shall fly too!
All right, let the battle begin! Dadadadadada.
Yowl!
Rarrr!
Whoosh!
What? Running away?!
Chomp! Chomp!
Ah-ah! It seems you're unable to bite me!
Oh, really?

What's that you want?
You want me to stop?

Sakaki:
Background.

Tomo:
So, what's this?
Oh, something you drew huh?
It's kinda too peaceful for the background on the ultimate battle to save the Earth.
But I guess it's gonna help set the mood a little better.

Meow! Meow! Hiss!
I won't let you have your way!
Give it up! I have won!
I will never give in!
Ha-ha-ha-ha...
Ha-ha-ha-ha...

Chiyo:
Please you guys, get to work!
The culture fest is happening tomorrow!

Tomo:
Yeah, yeah, okay.

Chiyo:
Oh, we're never gonna make it at this rate!

Student:
Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Yes!

Student:
Class Rep!

Chiyo:
Yes!

Student:
What about this?!

Student:
Take a look at this!

Tomo:
Huh? Did that Kagura run out on us?

Yomi:
She's helping with the swim team's preparations!

Tomo:
Ah, I don't know what I should do now!

Chiyo:
Tomo, please take care of this!


16-3. Cute
Chiyo:
Just in time!

Yukari:
Yo, is everyone over here ready?
They just opened the doors.
Are you ready yet?

Osaka:
I am, but just barely.

Yukari:
Wow! What's that? It's cute!

Osaka:
This is a father hat.
And it's our uniform.

Yukari:
Father hat?

Osaka:
Miss Sakaki started callin' it that for some reason.

Yukari:
Why is that?

Osaka:
Only Miss Sakaki would know.

Yukari:
Oh...

Yukari:
Ah!

Tomo:
Practice bringing out coffee quickly!

Yukari:
What do you have on your head?

Sakaki:
Neco Coneco.

Kagura:
Practice bringing out iced coffee...

Sakaki:
Neco Coneco.

Yukari:
Well, I know what that is, but...

Osaka:
The explanation for that is that we couldn't make enough hats for everyone in time, so we decided to do this for people who don't have one.

Yukari:
I... I see...
Well, that's fine, but...

Yukari:
Hiya... anyone seen Chiyo-chan?

Yomi:
Oh, Chiyo-chan just left to go changing into a special costume.

Yukari:
Special?

Kaorin:
Yes, for I, Kaorin,

Chihiro:
And I, Chihiro...

Kaorin, Chihiro:
Combined our abilities together and specially made the "Special Costume"!

Yukari:
Special?

Chiyo:
I'm back.

Yukari:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Oh, grab on this.
I got it open!

Yukari:
Whoa!

Chiyo:
How is it, Miss Yukari?

Yukari:
Oh...

Chiyo:
Miss Yukari!
Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
Wow, it's so cute! I can just...

Chiyo:
What did you do that for?!

Yukari:
Oh, I just sorta felt like it.

Tomo:
Huh?

Chiyo:
What was that all about?!

Tomo:
Whoa! Chiyo-chan, you're so cute!
I won't be fooled.
Do you hear me?
You can try to fool me all you want with that evil cuteness!

Chiyo:
Really, Tomo, you always say such mean things, pht!
I shouldn't listen to her.

Tomo:
Oh, so cute.

Yomi:
Okay, let's let the customers in!

Everyone:
Yeah!

Chiyo:
All right, let's get to it!
But I'm still a little nervous.
Will the customers enjoy our stuffed animal cafe?

That kind of attitude just won't do!
Do not give into the pressure and let's enjoy the once-a-year culture fest to the fullest possible extent!
Some exercise might be a good idea.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four, ah...
I fell over!
It's really hard for me to get up!

Everyone:
It's so cute.

Osaka:
In the end, I think this tree is gonna look better over...

Tomo:
Hey, Osaka!

Osaka:
Hm?

Tomo:
Did you see it?!
Did you see that?!

Osaka:
Hm? See what?

Tomo:
Chiyo-chan and her penguin exercises!

Osaka:
I didn't see nothin'.

Tomo:
You idiot!

Osaka:
Huh? Why?


16-4. Ordering
Student:
Balloon fishing!
You gotta do balloon fishing at a festival!
Check it out! Year 2, Class 4!

Osaka:
Oh, Miss Kurosawa.
How 'bout a nice cup of tea?

Nyamo:
Ooh, you're doing a cafe, aren't you?

Osaka:
It's very cute.
So cute, you'll be like, how could this be?

Nyamo:
Oh, really, now?
I have to be careful, since it's something you guys put together.

Osaka:
You don't have to worry.
There ain't any dead cats or anythin'.

Nyamo:
Huh?

Osaka:
This table over here is free.

Nyamo:
Okay, I'll sit here, then.

Osaka:
It's a window seat.

Nyamo:
I think I'll have a coffee.

Osaka:
Right!
One coffee!

Yomi:
Okay!

Nyamo:
Hmm, that's some attention to detail.

Yomi:
Deliver this for me, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Okay!

Yomi:
Here you are. I appreciate it.

Chiyo:
Sure!

Nyamo:
Huh? Ah!

Chiyo:
Here's your coffee. There.

Nyamo:
She's so adorable...

Chiyo:
Here's your cream.

Nyamo:
Okay.

Chiyo:
Enjoy.

Nyamo:
Uh, are you okay, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
I'm... okay...

Nyamo:
Brilliant.

Yukari:
How about it?

Nyamo:
Huh?

Yukari:
Incredible, isn't it?
Well, I guess there's no match else who could compete with that kind of sheer cuteness, huh!

Nyamo:
I agree with you, but what reason do you have to be all proud of it?

Yukari:
Huh? You don't know?
I happen to be Chiyo-chan's homeroom teacher.
I bet you would've liked to have a kid like that in your class, wouldn't ya?
I know you would have!

Nyamo:
But, somehow I still feel sorry for all those kids.

Student:
Oh, welcome.

Student:
Welcome.

Kimura:
Ah!

Student:
What can I get you, sir?

Kimura:
Uh... Uh... Uh...

Kimura:
Excuse me, Miss Waitress, I'd like to order now, please.

Kagura:
What?
So what can I get you?

Kimura:
I want that?

Kagura:
What?

Kimura:
Would you lend me one of those hats?

Kagura:
Um, here you go.

Kimura:
I'm ready.

Stuffed Animal Cafe!
It's really cute!
Stuffed Animal Cafe!
Why don't you come on over!
Is really cute!
I'm telling you!

Kagura:
We don't need any help attracting customers!

Kimura:
Huh?

Kagura:
You got it?

Kagura:
I'm Kagura!
The fact that I'm 156cm tall has nothing to do with the culture fest!

Sakaki:
Oh. Sakaki. Um...

Kimura:
Is really really cute, come on!


16-5. Advertising Reach
Student:
Man, that was cute, really cute.

Yomi:
Thank you so much for stopping by.

Tomo:
Hold it, Kaorin, those aren't regulation kitty ears.

Kaorin:
Oh, I was wearing the other kind before but...

Kagura:
Oh! Wait a minute!
You mean the one I let Kimura borrow?!
It hasn't come back yet?

Tomo:
Okay!
It's time to go and retrieve Kaorin's father hat!

Yomi:
Oh, no, you've been wandering around school all this time.
So you don't need to go anywhere.

Tomo:
Huh...

Yomi:
Oh, hey, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Yes, what?

Yomi:
Well, the crowd's died down a bit, so why don't we start taking breaks in shifts, okay?

Chiyo:
That's a good idea.

Tomo:
In that case, I should go first...
Ouch!

Yomi:
No, Chiyo-chan and Osaka will take a first break.

Chiyo:
Sure it's okay?

Osaka:
Hurrah! Chiyo-chan, are you ready?
Let's go and pig out on lots of snacks.

Chihiro:
Wait a minute, Chiyo-chan!
If you're going to walk around the school anyway, we can advertise while you're at it!

Chiyo:
Oh, that's a good idea!

Chiyo:
See you later!

Osaka:
We'll go enjoy the culture fest!

Tomo:
I get to go next.

Yomi:
You're on hold, Tomo.

Chiyo:
Look, Miss Osaka, they have fried octopus ball!

Osaka:
You're right!
Chiyo-chan, fried octopus ball is somethin' ya always gotta get when ya go visit a culture fest.
Let's go get some.

Chiyo:
Yes!

Student:
Thanks for waiting!

Chiyo:
It looks really delicious.
My arms don't reach, so I can't eat it.

Osaka:
Now we can't be having any of that.
Okay, open up your mouth and say "Ah", Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Uh... Ah!

Osaka:
Here you go!

Osaka:
Sounds like it's good.
I'm glad for ya, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
It's very delicious!

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, do you like octopus balls?

Chiyo:
Oh yes, I love them!

Miss Osaka!
These people have taiyaki pastries.
What will we do?

Osaka:
'Course, ya always gotta have taiyaki pastries at a culture fest, don't ya?

Osaka, Chiyo:
We would like a taiyaki pastry each!

Yay, let's get started!

Chiyo:
Ah!

Osaka:
Oh, oh yeah.
You know how some people eat taiyaki pastries startin' from the head and some people start from the tail?
So which end do you like to start eatin' from?
Oh...
Okay, Chiyo-chan, say "Ah" for me.

Chiyo:
Ah!

Osaka:
One more thing, Chiyo-chan.
You wanna start with the head or with the tail?

Chiyo:
Head first, please, Miss Osaka.

Osaka:
I got ya. Dig in.

Chiyo:
It's delicious!

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, do ya like taiyaki pastries?

Chiyo:
High school is so nice because we get to do the culture fest.

Osaka:
I hear ya.
Like me? It's like I can be happy the rest of the year simply because there's the culture fest.

Chiyo:
That's incredible.

Hey everyone, we came back!

Osaka:
We had a really good time!

Yomi:
Just what kind of advertising did you do?!

Kagura:
It's been way too effective!

Tomo:
There's no time for breaks!

Chiyo:
Oh, gosh...

Student1:
Man, we sure sold a lot!

Student2:
I'm so tired!

Student3:
It was a huge hit!

Tomo:
Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Yeah.

Tomo:
We're doing a toast with the leftover juice!

Chiyo:
Okay!

Sakaki:
Hm...
Oh.
Mm-hm.


-- Preview --

Osaka:
Christmas is comin' up.
It's almost the season for Santa to come.

Tomo:
Does Santa even really exist?
Besides, what does Santa do for you anyway?
Isn't it kind of suspicious for a stranger to be giving you presents?!

Osaka:
It sure is a mystery.
He's in cahoots with reindeer and he's got a big bag too.

Tomo:
What in the world does he have inside the bag?!

Osaka, Tomo:
Ooh!

Yomi:
Presents, okay?!

7-1. Osaka's Horror Story
Osaka:
Let's go home, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Oh, would you mind if we made a stop at a bookstore on the way?

Osaka:
No, that's fine. Is there some interesting book that just came out?

Chiyo:
Yeah, today, there's supposed to be a really cute photo collection of pandas coming out!

Osaka:
Really.

Chiyo:
But apparently it's been talked about a lot in advance, so I hope it won't be sold out.

Osaka:
I had no idea.

Girl:
Huh?

Nyamo:
Hey! No running in the hallway! Really. What's got her in such a hurry?

Osaka:
Speakin' of that, Chiyo-chan...

Chiyo:
Yes?

Osaka:
Concerning pandas...

Chiyo:
Yeah?

Osaka:
So which parts are supposed to be white and which parts are black again?

Chiyo:
Okay... Um...

Chiyo:
I finished it.

Osaka:
Don't you think it looks a little off the mark?

Chiyo:
Um... I think you may be right.

Osaka:
I'm pretty sure the one I saw on TV was more like... hmm...

Osaka:
Okay. This creature is a... er...

Chiyo:
This isn't right. That looks nothing like a panda.

Yomi:
Hey, what's up?

Tomo:
Let's go! Let's go!

Tomo:
What are those?

Yomi:
Maybe animals?

Chiyo:
They're pandas.

Osaka:
Pandas.

Tomo and yomi:
Pandas?

Osaka:
Actually, to tell you the truth, I've never seen a panda in real life with my very own eyes yet.

Tomo:
Oh, well, I have seen one before. It was at the zoo, and it was totally cute.

Osaka:
Oh. Well then, tell me this...

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Was it black spots on white? Or was it white spots on a black background?

Tomo:
Well, er...

Chiyo:
Then we should go see pandas together some time!

Yomi:
Ooh, I agree.

Osaka:
Oh! Don't get me wrong, I do wanna see the pandas, but there's also somethin' else I wanna see while we're at it.

Tomo:
What's that?

Osaka:
Mmm. You know we knew... that thing that happens when you... like um...
Oh, yeah... My life flashin'!

Tomo:
I'd advise against that.

Osaka:
Come to think of it, I had a terrifyin' experience only yesterday.

Tomo:
Ooh! Let's hear it. What happened? Spit it out, will you? Don't tell me woke up and started speaking normal like all of us do.

Osaka:
Ooh! That... That'd be scary too. Mmm... Hi! Hiya!

Tomo:
That's not how we talk. But never mind that. Get on with the story!

Osaka:
Some time last night, I was all alone in my room, when suddenly, outta nowhere the smell of a fart that wasn't mine wafted into my nose.

Tomo:
Uh... Spooky!

Osaka:
Isn't it?

Yomi:
Really?


17-2. Change of Pace
Yukari:
Oh, shoot! Now I'm gonna be late again!

Kimura:
Miss Tanizaki.

Yukari:
Yeah, what?

Kimura:
Is it because it's almost Christmas?

Yukari:
Huh?

Kimura:
Yule be running to get my present, huh?
That certainly is some sense of humor you got there, Miss Tanizaki!
Hahahaha.

Yukari:
Yeah, um, I'm in a bit of a hurry.

Tomo:
Hey, hey, what was the old-fashioned name for the time around Christmas again?
Uh, was it "Mule"?

Yomi:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Oh, I believe the word you're looking for is "Yule."

Osaka:
Ah!

Tomo:
Ah!

Osaka, Tomo:
Ah!

Chiyo:
What?

Tomo:
Thanks a lot, Chiyo-chan.
Why are you gonna steal the punch line?

Osaka:
That's right, you just shouldn't do that.

Chiyo:
Um... I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry...

Osaka:
You shouldn't, Chiyo-chan. You shouldn't...

Yomi:
Don't take anything they say seriously, Chiyo-chan.

Tomo:
Ah, ahem.
Now as I was saying...
What was that old name for the time around Christmas again?

Yomi:
Don't do it over!

Yukari:
Okay, you can sit down!
I am sick and tired of being just a language teacher!
So, instead, I'll be teaching you kids math today.

Yomi:
Math, huh?

Yukari:
Argh!
We're doing P.E.
Everyone, get outside!

Tomo:
So cold!

Yomi:
Now how do we go straight from language to P.E.?

Chiyo:
I wonder what we'll be doing in Miss Yukari's P.E. class?

Osaka:
Think it'll be like an American P.E.?

Kagura:
Whether it's American or British, I won't be losing to you, Sakaki!

Yukari:
Yeah, let's play a little soccer!

Tomo:
Yukari, do you even know the rules?

Yukari:
Just leave it to me!
I'm Mia Hamm!

Tomo:
Huh?

Yukari:
I'm Mia Hamm!

Tomo:
What does that mean?

Yukari:
Take that!

Girl:
Huh?

Yukari:
Goal!
Goal, goal, goal, goal, goal, goal...

Yomi:
Miss Yukari, you do know that's our goal, right?

Yukari:
Actually, I was a spy for the other team!

Yomi:
You're not making any sense.

Yukari:
I'll get it in for sure this time!
Move it, move it, move it, move...
Huh? What the...?

Yukari:
Enough soccer!
Let's play dodge ball!

Nyamo:
Hm?
What's Yukari's class having P.E. for?

Osaka:
Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no. Oh, no...
Ah!

Chihiro:
Take that!

Kaorin:
Go, Miss Sakaki!

Chiyo:
Uh... uh...

Yukari:
Ah!

Chiyo:
Uh... uh...

Girl:
I've been hit!

Chiyo:
Uh... uh...
I'm... I'm the only one left on my side!

Tomo:
Prepare yourself to die!

Take that!

Yomi:
Just hit her already.

17-3. Yule
Yukari:
Hm...

Nyamo:
Is there some reason you're looking all serious?
What is that?

Yukari:
It's a gift catalogue.

Nyamo:
Wow, you're gonna send something?
Who's it for?

Yukari:
Huh?
What's the point in giving it to other people?

Nyamo:
Hm?

Yukari:
Although, looking at this stuff makes you feel like you're just rolling in money.

Nyamo:
It does?

Yukari:
Oh, yeah, this one.
But this one too, in its own way.
Oh! This one's hard to give up, too!

Nyamo:
Oh, that tableware set's pretty nice.

Yukari:
Hm!

Nyamo:
Aw!
What was that?!

Yukari:
Are you some kind of idiot?!
This is no time to be acting all cool.
Look! It's snow crabs! Snow crabs!
Really, to think you pick flatware over crabs.
Hm? Hey, there, Miss Minamo?

Nyamo:
What?

Yukari:
Have you ever had Matsusaka beef before?

Nyamo:
No, I never have.

Yukari:
It's supposed to be delicious.

Nyamo:
So I've heard.

Chiyo:
Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
Hm?

Chiyo:
Here you are.
I brought this for you.

Yukari:
Oh, thank you very much.
By the way, Chiyo.

Chiyo:
Yes.

Yukari:
Tell me, have you ever eaten something called Matsusaka beef?

Chiyo:
Um, oh, yup, I had that!

Ow! That hurt!

Yukari:
Then, if you could have anything in this catalog, what would you order?

Chiyo:
Oh! The ice cream set on this page looks really yummy!

Yukari:
Ice cream?
Does that mean you're just a little kid?
Or is it the complacency of the bourgeois?
Matsusaka beef is more delicious, right?!


Osaka:
Merry Christmas, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Hello, Miss Osaka.
What are you doing there?

Osaka:
Merry Christmas to you!

Chiyo:
Oh, it's almost Christmas time, isn't it?

Osaka:
That's right. Merry Merry Christmas!

Chiyo:
I'm so excited!
I can't wait to see what presents I'll get this year!

Osaka:
Me, too.

Chiyo:
Yeah.

Kagura:
Say, does Chiyo-chan...
You think she still believes in Santa?

Tomo:
Well, who knows?
Why don't we just go and ask her?

Chiyo-chan, are you one of those people who still believes in Santa?

Kagura:
Ah! Moron!

What are you gonna do if she does believe?!
You shouldn't go and destroy her dreams like that, you know!

Tomo:
Then, how are you gonna explain it to her?

Kagura:
Explain?

Tomo:
For example, what if she wants to know where the money comes from to pay for presents for all the kids in the country, huh?

Kagura:
Um, well...
Government!
It's the government who pays Santa.

Tomo:
And not everyone has the chimneys, so how does he get in then?

Kagura:
Don't underestimate him!
See, Santa's got awesome lock picking skills!
Pick and open anything!

Tomo:
Okay, so, how does he go to every house in the world in just one night?

Kagura:
He's fast!
He's tremendously fast!
Like at mach 100!

Tomo:
Yeah, right.
No human could do all that.

Kagura:
Santa isn't human!

Tomo:
What?! Are you saying he's some kind of alien or something?!

Kagura:
No, I'm not saying he's from outer space, you idiot!

Tomo:
Then where?!
Under the earth?!
The ocean floor?!
What is he?! An alien?!
A subterranean?! From the depths of the sea?

Chiyo:
Um, don't worry, I already know.

Kagura, Tomo:
What?!

Tomo:
Is he really an alien?

Kagura:
Or a mole man?!

Chiyo:
Tha... that is...

Chiyo:
You see Mr. Santa is really your father.

Kagura:
My father?

Tomo:
Okay.

Chiyo:
Yes, that's right.

Sakaki:
Santa... is her father?

Chiyo Papa:
Merry...

Osaka:
What's the matter?


17-4. Amazing Santa
Chiyo Papa:
Chiyo.
Merry Christmas.

Chiyo:
Oh, thank you so much!
Yay! My father is Mr. Santa!

Chiyo Papa:
Yes, that's right.
The government pays me to deliver presents to everyone.

Chiyo:
Amazing!

Chiyo Papa:
And I can fly at mach 100.

Chiyo:
Amazing! Amazing!

Kaorin:
Huh? Huh? Huh?


Tomo:
Say, Yomi?

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
So, like, if you could ask for anything you wanted as a Christmas present, anything at all, what would you wanna get?

Yomi:
Anything...
You really mean like anything at all?
Even a hundred trillion yen?

Tomo:
Um... May be something a little more realistic.

Yomi:
A little more realistic?
Then how much are we talking about?
Is ten million low enough?

Tomo:
Well, I guess if you're gonna ask for a price...

Chiyo:
What are you two talking about?

Tomo:
Hey, Chiyo-chan, so what would you like as a Christmas present?

Chiyo:
Well... um...
Oh, you know the big Christmas tree out in front of the train station?
I'd really like that big star decorating the very tip-top.
I've always wanted something like that.

Tomo:
Wow!
This is what we call a pure and unadulterated soul, my dear Yomi.

Yomi:
Uh...

Tomo:
One hundred trillion yen, eh?
There, there.
What's wrong? What's wrong?

Kagura:
Hey.
Might I ask you something?

Tomo:
What's with... being so formal?

Kagura:
Now I know Santa doesn't exist, but...

Tomo:
Mm-hm.

Kagura:
Reindeer do exist, don't they?

Tomo:
Hahahaha.
This girl believes in reindeer!

Chiyo, Yomi:
What?!

Tomo:
Huh?

Yomi:
Reindeer do exist.

Chiyo:
Mm-hm.

Tomo:
You're lying!
Flying deer do not exist, Yomi!
You're trying to trick me!
I'm not falling for it!
Hahahaha.

Yomi:
Okay, she is confused.

Tomo:
Sakaki, reindeer don't exist in this world, do they?

Sakaki:
They do.

Tomo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Hey, Osaka, do reindeer really exist?

Osaka:
Yup, they sure do.

Tomo:
Huh?

Sakaki:
Reindeer really do exist.

Chiyo:
They can't fly, but they look like this style, right here?
Deer and reindeer are really two different creatures.

Tomo:
What?! What the heck?!
I'm not stupid! I'm not stupid, okay?!


Osaka:
I gotta start writting New Year's cards.

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Say, Tomo.
What year of the Chinese zodiac is next year supposed to be?

Tomo:
Um...

Tomo, Osaka:
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, adder...

Osaka:
Okay, what's this year's Chinese zodiac?

Tomo:
No clue.

Tomo, Osaka:
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, adder...
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, adder...

Osaka:
I don't know what comes after dragon and adder, though.

Tomo:
Me neither.

Tomo, Osaka:
Rat, ox, tiger, rabbit, dragon, adder...

Tomo:
Oh, I just remembered.
This year is the dragon.
Dragon.

Osaka:
Then next year will be the adder.
The adder.

Tomo:
The adder.

Osaka:
Uh...

Tomo:
Adder...

Osaka:
Ain't that the hanging parts on a cow or something?


17-5. Christmas Party

Yukari:
Okay, time to hand out report cards!
Well, let's start with Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Yes!

Yukari:
Chiyo-chan, you're the top second year student.

Chiyo:
Aha!

Yukari:
Not that this kind of studying will be very useful to you once you're out in the real world.

Chiyo:
Uh...

Yukari:
Next, Tomo.

Tomo:
Hm?

Yukari:
You need to start working a little harder, Missy.

Tomo:
What?
But it won't be useful once we're out in the real world, right?

Yukari:
You idiot!
This is what scholastics are all about!
If you want wisdom that's useful in life, go read grandma's fountain of wisdom or something.


Chiyo:
Sorry I'm late!
Thanks for waiting for me!

Tomo:
All right! Merry Christmas!
Let's party tonight!
Here's the agenda!
We'll hang out for a while, go sing karaoke, eat cake at Chiyo-chan's, and have a big-ass slumber party!
Okay, let's go!

Osaka:
You know, I always think about this every year when Christmas comes around.

Chiyo:
Yeah?

Osaka:
They have that one story about the red nosed reindeer, right?
I can't help thinking how terrible it is.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Sure his shiny nose may be really useful for dark roads at night...
But that ain't no consolation.
I mean if ya told a bald person that his head was useful on the road at night, you'd just get clobbered.
Santa sure does say some mean things.

Chiyo:
Uh-huh?

Osaka:
But the reindeer's also got its own issues.

Chiyo:
Really?

Osaka:
What kinda nose does he have that lights up the road?
And where did he get it from?
It just might be that he's not a reindeer after all.
I bet he's somethin' else...

Chiyo:
Hahaha...


Osaka:
And if you stay, time passes by.

Everyone:
Yay!

Osaka:
Hey, I got sixty-five.

Yomi:
I said that's pretty good, Osaka.

Tomo:
Yeah, way better than your last test score.

Chiyo:
Huh?
Oh, right.

Yomi, Tomo:
Hm?

Sakaki:
There may be some day that I open up inside.
Forget this parachute and see when my heart falls.
While I was waiting in the park it came to me.
If I was going home,
A detour on our way,
A side trip with my friends,
Or shall we turn around,
An ordinary day.

Chiyo:
Wow!

Osaka:
That was good!

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, that was amazing!

Tomo:
You're really good at this, you know!

Yomi:
Uh-huh.

Osaka:
Yeah, talk about a surprise.

Yomi:
Then, I guess I'll do one too.

Tomo:
What? You will?

Yomi:
Hop, hop, hop, hopping around, how are you? How are you?
Ding-dong, ding-dong, the bells ring on that hill, on that hill...

Tomo:
Man, we sure sang whole a lot!
But I have to say Miss Yomi's singing really was something else, huh!

Osaka:
That was another big surprise.

Tomo:
This girl's good at school and sports, but singing is the one thing she totally sucks at big time.

Yomi:
Who cares?!
As long as she puts her heart into it!

Tomo:
Your heart, huh?

Yomi, Tomo:
Huh?

Sakaki:
It's snowing.

Chiyo:
Oh, wow, snow on Christmas!
Isn't that so romantic?!

Kimura:
Yup.
It's a white Christmas for sure.

Everyone:
Mr. Kimura!
What the...?!


-- Preview --

Tomo:
Hokkaido sure is nice, you know?
The food there is good and you get to ski too.

Yomi:
I went there.

Tomo:
They've got bears and hot springs!
It's like the entire city is the great out doors!

Yomi:
I went to Hokkaido.

Tomo:
What?! Behind my back?! When?!

Yomi:
I also got to eat crabs.

Everyone:
Crabs?!

Yukari:
Is it crabs next episode?!
Will we get to eat crab?!

Nyamo:
You won't get to eat crabs, but don't miss it, okay?

18-1. Yomi's Exposure to the World
Tomo:
Ahhhh!

Chiyo:
Wow, that's a strange dream.

Osaka:
Uh-huh.
Even weirder than last year.
You know what I mean?

Yomi:
Hello there, all my good friends.
Happy New Year.

Chiyo:
Oh, Happy New Year to you.

Osaka:
Happy New Year.

Sakaki:
Happy New Year.

Yomi:
So, everyone, how was your break?

Chiyo:
I relaxed at the warm heated table.

Osaka:
Uh... I was just meltin'...

Sakaki:
Mine was good.
Pretty quiet overall.

Chiyo:
What about you?

Tomo:
Hold on!

Chiyo:
Miss Yomi?

Tomo:
Wait, wait!
No, don't ask her!

Chiyo:
How was your break, Miss Yomi?

Yomi:
Actually, I took a little trip to Hokkaido.

Chiyo:
Wow!

Tomo:
Ugh!

Yomi:
Oh, by the way, have any of you ever been on an airplane?

Osaka:
Oh, no I haven't.

Sakaki:
Me, neither. Never.

Tomo:
Um, No!

Chiyo:
I have though!

Yomi:
Hehehe.
Chiyo-chan, let's go over here for a little chat?

Tomo:
It was still your first time, you know!

Yomi:
Here, a souvenir.

Chiyo:
Yay!

Osaka:
Thank you, Yomi.
Hm?
"White Friend, Black"?

Osaka, Chiyo:
Huh?

Yomi:
Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Huh?

Yomi:
Here.
I heard you liked bears and things, so...
It's made with bear.
Cool, huh?

Sakaki:
Argh...

Osaka:
Wow, lucky you.
Ain't that great, Miss Sakaki?

Tomo:
Oh! Yomi!

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
Over... New Year's... did you... gain some weight?!
Ahahaha.
A bull's-eye?
Did you loosen up in Hokkaido and eat too much?!
Is that it, Yomi?
Ahahaha.
So, was it rice cakes or sweet bean soup?!

Yomi:
C-Crabs...

Tomo:
Huh? Say that again? Huh?

Yomi:
Crab... you dope...

Tomo:
Ah!

Yomi:
It was all you can eat, so...

Tomo:
Ah!
All you can eat, crab?! Idiot!
No fair!
I'm gonna go tell Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
In Hokkaido?!
Snow crab?!
All you can eat?!

Tomo:
Yomi, it was all Yomi...

Yomi:
What?! You really got her!

Yukari:
Was it good? Was it good?! It was good, wasn't it?!

Yomi:
Yes...

Yukari:
You had more than just crabs, didn't you?
What else did you eat?!

Yomi:
Genghis Khan, I guess.

Yukari:
Genghis Khan?!

Yukari:
What was Genghis Khan again?

Tomo:
I don't know, my lady.

Yukari:
We'll ask Chiyo-chan.

Yukari, Tomo:
Just you wait!

Chiyo:
It's a Hokkaido specialty.
Genghis Khan is mutton that is cooked in a slightly different kind of pan than usual.

Yukari:
Oh...

Tomo:
So, is that good?

Chiyo:
Yes, it's delicious.

Yukari:
What else?!
You had other kinds of fun too, didn't you?!
Oh! You went to a hot spring, right?!

Yomi:
Well, an open-air bath...

Tomo:
Oh, my good!

Yukari:
What outdoors?! In the nude?!

Tomo:
Pervert!

Yomi:
What are you talking about, huh?!

Yukari:
So, which hot spring was it?

Yomi:
Noboribetsu.

Yukari:
Noboribetsu?
Noboribetsu Karls!
Oh, I know! It's that white bath salt!
I've bathed in that before!
Noboribetsu is great, isn't it?!
After all, it's exceptional, you know?!
Probably the best spring...

Tomo:
Wow!
She thinks they have something in common just 'cause there's the bath salt?!

Yukari:
I hear the bears in the area all bathe there too!
Hurray for hot springs! Hurray!
Viva the hot springs!

Yomi:
I'm gonna quit bragging from now on.
Especially to these guys.


18-2. Betrayal
Tomo:
So, which one should I get?
Hm, this one!

Tomo:
Hm? Oh, the cup!
My-My milk tea!
Stop it! Stop it!

Chiyo:
Ah!

Osaka:
What a disaster!

Tomo:
Uh....

Chiyo:
Oh...

Tomo:
I... I trusted you...

Chiyo:
Um, would you like some?

Tomo:
I'm afraid I'll never be able to use this vending machine again.

Osaka:
Trust in you has just plummeted, my friend.

Yomi:
Hey, what are you doing?

Osaka:
Well, you see...

Tomo:
Oh, dear Koyomi, buy some juice, will you?

Yomi:
You don't need to tell me, that's what I came for.
I'll take a milk tea.

Yomi:
Hey, it... came out with two cups.

Tomo:
Ahahaaan.

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
It... It can't be!

Yomi:
What?
What's wrong?
Did I do something?

Chiyo, Osaka:
Huh...


Yomi:
So, I got to ski too.
The snow was powdery, not packed at all.

Chiyo:
Was it really?
Wow!

Osaka:
Wow, thick noodles with curry?
I didn't think of that.

Tomo:
Curry noodles!

Everyone:
Huh?

Tomo:
Danger!
Everyone run!
This stuff's gonna splatter!

Yomi:
Don't you worry, I'll be careful.

Tomo:
Ah! Being careful is useless!
It'll splatter no matter what!
And in the end, you'll be covered in curry!
Finally, Yomi has a miserable food experience too!
Aaahhhh....

Osaka:
Wow, you're really good.
You haven't splattered at all yet.
You certainly are somethin' else.

Chiyo:
That's amazing.

Yomi:
Well, I have loved thick noodles ever since I was small.

Tomo:
That's... it... damn you!
I am hated!

Yomi:
What on earth has gotten into you?!

What is with you today?!

Tomo:
Come back, you, right on!

Chiyo:
Oh, Tomo!

Yomi:
Whoa, whoa, stay away from me!

Tomo:
Stop right there!

Osaka:
The town's in an uproar!

Ow... that hurt!

Yomi:
Whoa...

Tomo:
Hahaha...

Yomi:
We can talk it over.

Tomo:
My grudge over the milk tea...
No, that's not all.
My grudge over the crab and the Genghis Khan too!
I won't let you have all the fun, you hear me!

Yomi:
Why me?!

Yomi:
Huh?

Yomi:
It's all soggy now.
18-3. Excited, Excited, Excited, Excited
Girl1:
If you don't hurry, I'm leaving.

Girl2:
Wait for me!

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, let's go home.

Yomi:
What are you reading?

Osaka:
Huh? Information pamphlets.
Hearin' all about Yomi's stories of Hokkaido, well it, it made me feel like I wanted to get up and go somewhere too.
And I found someplace that looks interestin'.

Chiyo:
Oh, that's Magical Land, isn't it?!

Yomi:
What's Magical Land?

Chiyo:
Oh, it's a theme park that opened just the other day.
I've really been wanting to go there.

Yomi:
Wow.

Chiyo:
I know!
Why don't we take a trip there... like maybe this coming weekend?

Yomi:
Oh.

Osaka:
Yeah.

Tomo:
I agree!
If it's plans like that, let me in!
I'm in! I want in! How could I not?! Yay! Yay! Yay!

Chiyo:
You're really energetic.

Tomo:
A theme park! A theme park!

Yomi:
Such a child.

Tomo:
What did you say?!
Are you saying you aren't looking forward to it?!
Is that it?

Yomi:
Not so much that I'd get as excited as you are.

Tomo:
Hah! Acting all mature!
And thus, your eyes had lost the glimmer of childhood that sparked beautiful energy!

Yomi:
What's that even mean?

Osaka:
Yomi, Yomi, I've got some big news!

Yomi:
Huh?

Osaka:
The roller-coaster they got there is the best in Japan!

Yomi:
Wow.

Tomo:
"Best in Japan", huh?
Cool!

Chiyo:
They say it's absolutely terrifying.

Osaka:
They seem to have a lot of people who start cryin' too.

Chiyo:
And this other attraction next to it looks like it'll be really fun too.

Yomi:
Huh.

Tomo:
See?
Even stuffy old grown-up Miss Yomi is beginning to get excited.
Oh, I can just see it. I can just see it!
Yomi running around like a little kid, dancing in all the way.
Oh, uh-oh, she tripped.
Oh, don't cry.

Yomi:
Quit seeing weird things!

Tomo:
Huh?


Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Yomi!

Yomi:
Oh! Hi, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
So, are you out shopping?

Yomi:
Well, yeah, kind of.

Chiyo:
Me too.
I came put here so I could buy the guidebook for Magical Land.
After all, it's tomorrow.
I'm so excited!

Yomi:
Oh, are you?

Chiyo:
What did you end up buying, Miss Yomi?

Yomi:
Oh, well, I uh... I bought a reference book.
That's all.
Oh, my mom asked me to go do some shopping.
I'll see you later, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Okay.

Yomi:
See you tomorrow!

Chiyo:
Bye!

Yomi:
Hehehe.

Achoo!
Oh, no...
Achoo!
Not good. Did I catch a chill?

This one... maybe not...
This too...
Oh, we definitely have to check this one out.
Huh? Oh! We have to try this ride, even if we have to wait almost an hour.
What? It could be more than an hour?
Huh, what should we do?
We could...
But Tomo wanna wait that long?
Hmm... No way, these are linked! Then we gotta...


18-4. Left Out
Tomo:
There we go!
Uh-huh.
Yup?
Oh, what's up, Yomi?
Huh? You can't?! But why?
Fever?!

Chiyo:
Huh?
Miss Yomi has a fever?!

Tomo:
She said she got it this morning.

Kagura:
Oh, man, that really sucks for Yomi.

Chiyo:
Then, we should cancel today's trip and go visit Miss Yomi.

Tomo:
Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk.
Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Yes?

Tomo:
Chiyo-chan, you really are such a child.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Listen, if we did that, Yomi might feel all guilty.

Chiyo:
Uh...

Tomo:
Therefore, the right thing to do is leave Yomi alone and have all the fun we can!

Chiyo:
What? Uh, is... it... really?

Tomo:
All right, then I guess it's settled, off we go!

Everyone:
Yay!

Chiyo:
Running on stairs is dangerous, you guys!

Being rowdy on the train platform is dangerous, too!

Tomo:
Let's go!


Yomi:
By now, everyone'll be...
Oh, but maybe they'll come by and try to surprise me with their visit.

Yomi's Mom:
Koyomi, you have a phone call from Miss Takino.

Yomi:
Hello?

Tomo:
Hello? Oh, Yomi?
We're getting on a roller-coaster now!
I'm gonna broadcast it to you live!

Yomi:
Hm!

Yomi:
Okay.

Yomi's Mom:
Koyomi, you have a phone call from Chiyo-chan.

Yomi:
Yes?

Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Yomi, are you okay?
Has your fever gone down?

Yomi:
Yeah, quite a bit.

Chiyo:
You really shouldn't get carried away and fall asleep naked.
Bad girl!

Yomi:
Wha... Wait a sec!
Who told you that?!
Tomo?! Did Tomo say that?!

Chiyo:
What? Um...

Yomi:
Get her on the phone right now!

Chiyo:
All, all right, I'll hand her the phone, please wait one minute.

Yomi:
Sure.

Tomo:
Whoa!

Chiyo:
Um, Tomo...

Tomo:
Hahaha. Man, that was fun!

Chiyo:
Um...

Osaka:
Oh, what's that thing?

Chiyo:
The phone...
Please wait!

Kagura:
What? That thing over there!

Chiyo:
Miss Yomi is on the phone!

Kagura:
Wow, awesome! Did you see that?

Chiyo:
Hello?

Osaka:
That'll kill ya. Just kill ya.

Chiyo:
Hello?

Tomo:
Let's go on that next! Go! Go!


Yomi:
Good morning!

Girl:
Morning, Yomi.

Chiyo:
Good morning.
Miss Yomi, I guess you're better now.
It's too bad about yesterday.

Yomi:
Hm... Well, thanks, Chiyo.
So, did you guys have fun there?

Chiyo:
Ah! Should I tell her honestly that I had a good time? Or should I...

Tomo:
Man, it was the best!
Every attraction they had there was just totally awesome!

Kagura:
Yeah! But there were so many people in line!

Osaka:
Oh, yeah, the crowd was so gigantic and we got tired just from that.

Kagura:
But no matter how much we had to wait, every ride we got on was worth it.

Tomo:
Really, Miss Kagura, ain't that the truth?

Osaka:
Hey, Tomo, where're ya from again?

Come to think of it, Tomo sure was noisy on that one ride.

Tomo:
Oh, that?
The guy in front has been really obnoxious.

Kagura:
Yeah, yeah, and on top of that...
That thing came flying.

Tomo:
Yeah, it had me sweating in the middle of winter.

Hey, It's no laughing... matter!

Kagura:
Now, now.
If we didn't enjoy life as much as we do, you couldn't have laughed it off, even if you wanted to.

Osaka:
You're exactly right.

Tomo:
So, there you go.
You were not coming, it was a really good thing
Huh?

Chiyo:
Ah...

Tomo:
Aaah! Ah!
Yomi's gone mad!

18-5. Go!
Chiyo:
Um, Miss Yomi.
About, earlier...

Yomi:
Oh, you don't need to apologize, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Well, um...
This here is the real souvenir.

Yomi:
Thank you, Chiyo.
Wow.

Chiyo:
That creature inside, he is the official mascot of Magical Land.

Yomi:
Oh...
Thank you so much, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Miss Yomi.
Let's all go together next time.
Okay?

Yomi:
Yeah.

Osaka:
Wow.
No wonder it's so cold.

Yomi:
Snow?

Chiyo:
Wow, it is snowing!

Osaka:
Real pretty, isn't it?

I hope it'll pile up.

Yomi:
Yeah.


Tomo:
Wow, so white!

Kagura:
It's awesome...

Osaka:
Huh.

Chiyo:
It's so pretty!

Tomo:
Let's do something! Let's do something! Let's do something!

Kagura:
Snowball fight!

Kagura, Tomo:
Yeah!

Tomo:
Great idea!

Osaka, Chiyo:
Yay! Ah!

Osaka:
Doesn't hurt, even if ya fall.
Aw!

Tomo:
Don't you let your guard down!
Aw!

Kagura:
Exactly!

Tomo:
Now you've done it!

Osaka:
Bombs away!

Chiyo:
It's cold!

Osaka:
I can't hit anyone at all.

Tomo:
Ha! Ha! Ha!

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, you're amazing!

Sakaki:
Not really...

Tomo:
Here goes!
Hey!

Yomi:
Hahahaha...
Did you forget?
I've been to Hokkaido!

Tomo:
Oh, really?

Osaka:
Here goes! Hah!

Kagura:
Wow, that was cool!

Chiyo:
Tomo, that's not fair!

Yomi:
Achoo! Achoo!

Chiyo:
What?


Yomi:
Stupid...


-- Preview --

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, what do you wanna do when you grow up?

Osaka:
I haven't really given it much thought.
I'm still living in my youth.
But ya know how they call youth the blue spring?
Are there such things as red springs or yellow springs?
What will they be?

Chiyo:
I don't really know.

Osaka:
Green springs, purple springs, orange springs, light-blue springs...

Chiyo:
Please watch us again next episode!

19-1. Yawn Master
Nyamo:
Oh, Mom...
Mm-hm, I saw the photo.
Yes, I'm sure it's a good match for an arranged marriage, it's too soon to be looking at that.
Honestly, how old do you think I am?

Nyamo's Mom:
What are you saying, Minamo?
It's not as if you're gonna be young forever.
And it's not often that you come across matches as nice as this one.

Nyamo:
Yeah... Yeah.
All right, Mom, but just a meeting.
Sure.
I'll give them a call as soon as I get a chance, okay?
Right, bye.

Nyamo:
All right!

Nyamo:
It's not as if I'll be young forever...
Oh, what am I saying?
I'm still young, you know!
Oh, yes, yes! Going!


Tomo:
Oh, man, I can't believe how sleepy I was!

Yomi:
Or rather, you were completely asleep!
Well, it can't be helped with this kind of weather.

Osaka:
For real, the weather sure is nice today, huh?

Chiyo:
It sure is.

Osaka:
Just sittin' out here in the warm sunlight, it feels like I'm all bundled up tight in a nice, fluffy blanket.
Uah!
Huh?

Yomi:
Well, it was... such a magnificent yawn, I couldn't take my eyes off it.

Chiyo:
Uh-huh.

Tomo:
So, so, so, <French>tres bien<French>!
Amazing!
It was the very picture of a yawn!
I've never seen a yawn quite like that!

Chiyo:
Really? Never?

Tomo:
Yeah!
It's like a woman who's come from the land of yawns to spread yawning all around the world!
Hey, yawn master!

Osaka:
Huh?

Yomi:
I don't think you need to go that far.

Tomo:
Very stately.
I guess that proves everybody has at least one redeeming trait.
Now, I charge you to instruct me in the ways of yawning here in the yawn training hall!

Osaka:
All right, then.

Yomi:
Come on, now.

Osaka, Tomo:
Uah...

Tomo:
No, that wasn't quite the same somehow.

Osaka:
Yeah, you're right.

Chiyo:
Please let me join in your training!

Chiyo, Osaka, Tomo:
Uah...

Yomi:
Well, I'm heading back to the classroom.

Sakaki:
Yeah, so am I.

Chiyo, Osaka, Tomo:
Uah...


19-2. Vaguely Youth
Tomo:
Shoot! Afternoon classes started already!

Chiyo:
Oh, it's your fault, Tomo!

Osaka:
Wait for me!

Nyamo:
You were sleeping on the roof?!
Why's that?!

Tomo:
Well, um, because the sky was just so blue, or something?

Nyamo:
You three to ten laps around the schoolyard!

Nyamo:
Honestly, I can't believe those girls!
Entrance exams are next year!

Yukari:
What's wrong?
Why are you so irritated?

Nyamo:
It's nothing.
Some girls from your class were apparently practicing yawning during lunch, and somehow all fell asleep on the roof.

Yukari:
What do you mean, practicing yawning?

Nyamo:
No idea!

Yukari:
I don't get it, but I don't see what's wrong with it either.
Taking it easy is the privileges of adolescence.

Nyamo:
Privilege, really?
But don't you think you can still only take that privilege so far?

Yukari:
I never mind that.
You wanna go flower gazing?

Nyamo:
Huh? Flower gazing?


Boy:
Hey, wait for me!


Tomo:
That's when I realized I had put hashed beef on my plate instead of curry!

Yomi:
So, you're saying you can't even tell hashed beef and curry apart?

Osaka:
Oh, sometimes, I can't tell 'em apart even after I'm gone and taking a big bite.

Chiyo:
What?!

Tomo:
That's having way too little sense of taste.

Yomi:
Like you're one to talk!


Boy:
Hey, we get ready to head out here, so... um...

Girl:
When you leave, make sure to turn all the lights out.

Tomo:
Roger that!

Yomi:
I didn't know it was this late already.

Chiyo:
It's starting to get dark outside.

Osaka:
You're right.

Yomi:
Shall we go home?


Chiyo:
Oh.

Chiyo:
Miss Kagura, isn't it?

Yomi:
Huh.

Tomo:
Makes you feel we're full of youthful energy, huh.

Yomi:
Basic strength training?

Tomo:
Yeah, so is that for the swim team?

Kagura:
Yeah, it's because I wanna make it all the way to the national level this year.
You could say I'm kinda gunning for it.

Osaka:
That's amazin'.

Yomi:
That's funny.
I always thought the swim team was on break except during the summer time.

Kagura:
You dummy!
Don't be thinking we're the same as you people in the Go-home Club!

Chiyo:
Go-home Club?
What kind of club is that, Miss Kagura?

Yomi:
Oh, it's the students who don't join any clubs and go home when classes are over.
In other words, people like us.

Kagura:
So, tell me, then what were you guys sticking around this late at school for?

Tomo:
Uh, because she said there were some book she had to check out

Chiyo:
And all of us went up to the library together.

Yomi:
But it was more like we were just sitting around and chatting there.

Kagura:
You're lucky.
You guys have sort of freedom about you.

Sakaki:
Freedom?

Tomo:
We're barely passing and you think we have freedom, do you?
The only part of freedom we have is a dumb part!

Chiyo:
That was there, Tomo...

Tomo:
Hey, you guys, was it really that unfunny?!
Hey! Hey, come on!


19-3. Adults' Flower Gazing
Yukari:
Whoa, this place is nice.

Nyamo:
You know I would've dressed more properly if I'd known it was gonna be this kind of place.
You said we were going flower gazing.

Yukari:
That's right.
I said we were going out to a hotel bar?

Nyamo:
That's news to me!

Yukari:
Well, it doesn't matter.

Nyamo:
Hey, wait!

Nyamo:
Wow, Eiko, a section chief?
I really have no idea how big companies work, but isn't that a pretty big deal?

Eiko:
Maybe, it seems I've gotten more work.
But the natural of it hasn't really changed too much.
You lecture your subordinates and get lectured by your supervisor.
Well, my work does directly affects the results of operations, so in that sense, it's work worth doing.

Nyamo:
That's amazing!
You seem so grown up, Eiko!

Eiko:
What are you saying?
You two are grownups too.

Nyamo:
Well, that's... that's true, but...

Yukari:
That's right!
We also have incredibly important demanding jobs, educating and shaping the minds of the promising youth of tomorrow!
We're totally grownup!
Hahaha...

Eiko:
Say, Minamo, you're a P.E. teacher, right?
Thought about switching jobs?

Nyamo:
Huh?

Eiko:
A sports gym affiliated with our company is looking for a chief instructor.
Naturally, you'd be treated as a full-time employee.
The place is high-class, so you'd easily double your salary.

Nyamo:
A new job?

Eiko:
Come on, don't act so shocked, Minamo.
I'm just saying, if you ever feel like it, okay?

Nyamo:
I'm really sorry.
You brought it up so suddenly, it just caught me off guard.

Eiko:
Will you consider it?

Nyamo:
No, I'm not switching jobs for anything, because to be honest, I love my current job.
Although...

Eiko:
Although?

Nyamo:
It never even occurred to me to think about changing my job...

Yukari:
No way! Stop it, Eiko!
Without Nyamo, I'd have to go through unavailable pain of walking to school on my own two feet!

Eiko:
What's that mean?


Chiyo:
Oh, my eraser...
All right, Mother and Father said they were going to be out of the house tonight.

What do I do now?

Kagura:
Hey.

Chiyo:
Oh, no, please spare me! No! No! I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry!
Please just help me out!.....

Kagura:
Calm down. Calm down!

What are you... doing out here so late, Chiyo?

Chiyo:
I ran out of convenience stores, uh, so I trip to the eraser...

Kagura:
Going to the store to buy an eraser, huh?

Chiyo:
Uh-huh.
This is the first time I've ever gone out this late at night by myself.

Kagura:
You better be careful. I've heard... they show up.

Chiyo:
Uh...?

Who is it?
Who shows up?

Kagura:
These guys.


Eiko:
Oh, hi!
Yeah, I'm out drinking right now.
Hold on a minute.

If I may ask, do the two of you have anyone special right now?

Yukari:
No, no, nope!
You won't be hearing any recent scandalous stories from us.
There's absolutely nothing to tell.

Eiko:
Okay! We've got the right number!
Hurry on over.

Yukari:
What was that?

Eiko:
Actually, I told the couple of the boys at work about you two.
They're on their way.
Both of them are pretty nice guys.

19-4. Children's Flower Gazing
Man:
Thank you very much.

Chiyo:
This is like going flower gazing.

Kagura:
By the way, thanks for treating me, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
No thank you.
You walked me to the convenience store, it's the least I could do.

Kagura:
Well, I couldn't just leave you alone after you looked at me like that.

Chiyo:
Going to the convenience store at night is so fun.
I guess once you're grownup, you can even shop in the middle of the night if you feel like.
Must be nice. I can't wait when I'm all grown up.

Kagura:
So, that's it.
Can't wait till you grow up, huh?

Chiyo:
And don't you wish you could, Miss Kagura?

Kagura:
Well, I guess I'd never really thought about it all that much.
I mean, thinking about me going to work and getting married...
I can't imagine it, not yet anyway.

Chiyo:
Going off to work somewhere and getting married...
Yeah, you're right.
That would be a little bit hard to imagine.

Kagura:
Yeah, well, in your case, you're still pretty little, so it's really not all that surprising.

Chiyo:
Oh, you think so?

Kagura:
Uh-huh.

Chiyo:
But I still can't wait for the day when I'm finally all grown up!


Nakku:
Hey, good evening! I'm Nakku, aka Nakuro Tanaka!

Mitchy:
I'm Mitchy, aka Michiru Ogino!

Nakku:
This is Nakku...

Mitchy:
And Mitchy's...

Nakku, Mitchy:
Thrilling Main Street of Youth!


Nakku:
Say, Mitchy, did you see the cherry blossoms in this town?
They're blooming really early this year.

Mitchy:
Yes, I saw!
The cherry trees in the park near the studio are totally in full bloom!

Nakku:
I'll bet people who were planning on going flower gazing next week or the week after are pretty disappointed.


Tomo:
Yo.

Yomi:
Oh, it's you.

Tomo:
Yeah.

Nakku:
Hey, if you don't change your plans and go soon, it'll be gone and we'll get there.

Mitchy:
xxxx any. Cherry blossoms scatter, you know?
I love cherry blossoms, but I don't like watching them scatter.

Nakku?
Oh, yeah, what's that?

Yomi:
I won't be chatting.

Tomo:
Hey, it's cool with me.

Mitchy:
It's sad watching something so beautiful scatter.
That's why I don't really like flower gazing that much.

Nakku:
Well, I can understand how you feel,
but I think maybe the beauty of flowers strike people's hearts
because they blossom so brilliantly,
then scatter just as quickly, you know.

Tomo:
Hey, wasn't that a good yawn just now?

Yomi:
You're still doing that?


Nyamo:
Honestly!
Those men took off because you had to go and say that.
You just had to open your big mouth!

Yukari:
Okay, it was my mistake.
I thought it'd be pretty funny.
But I guess I was wrong, huh.

Nyamo:
Your attitude hasn't changed in the least since our college days.

Yukari:
Oh, who cares if those silly guys don't like us, then too bad for them, you know?

Nyamo:
Funny that you're calling them silly now?
Oh, back there, you seemed to like them quite a bit.

Yukari:
Oh! Is that it, Nyamo?!
You wanted to catch guys that badly?!

Nyamo:
Well! Would it be that wrong if I had?!

Yukari:
Oh, so I see then, well, excuse me!
I'm so very, very sorry!

Nyamo:
Darn it!
Let's go and drink another round!

Yukari:
All right, and you're buying!

Nakku:
Let's see, this one's from Rice Cake with Bean Jam Chocolate.
That's a sweetie sounding name.
Well, Rice Cake has requested Yu Asakawa's "My Heart Is That Of A Little Girl and I Parachute"!

Mitchy:
Oh, I love this song!

Tomo:
Come to think of it...

Yomi:
What?

Tomo:
You know how today, when Kagura was talking to us.
She said something about us having freedom?
I've been wondering what she meant by that?

Yomi:
Oh, that thing.
Here's what I think, she meant that, be it club activities or studying or whatever, if you're working really hard at it, you sometimes get frantic about whether you'll accomplish your goals or not.

Tomo:
Huh.

Yomi:
There's nothing that we're working really hard at.
So, she probably meant we have more freedom because we have nothing to be frantic about.
But, personally, I kinda envy those people who have something they can really get into.

Tomo:
Oh, man, why didn't I join any clubs?!
Why, Yomi?

Yomi:
It's a little late for complaints.

Tomo:
Oh, well.


19-5. Cherry Blossoms
Chiyo:
You run at school and run at night also?

Kagura:
No, I was just having a hard time falling asleep, so I ran to refresh myself.
But after watching these cherry blossoms, I think I'll be able to fall asleep now.

Kagura:
Weird, isn't it?
This is something I'm doing because I want to, and yet I still get stressed over it.

Chiyo:
I hope you go to the Nationals, Miss Kagura.

Kagura:
Huh? Yeah, thanks, Chiyo-chan.
I'll make sure that I'll do my best.

Chiyo:
Good!


Nakku:
So, you see, Satchin from Saitama Prefecture, being dumped is certainly a sad thing, but you're not the only one in pain because your feelings aren't returned.

Mitchy:
Yeah, take Nakku.
He's been dumped countless times.

Nakku:
Yup.
I've been dumped left and right by girls since I was in school, I even ended up with the nickname, Emperor of Being Dumped, huh!
Hey, look at what you made me say!

Mitchy:
I'm sorry.

Tomo:
This is stupid!
I can't see why anyone would send postcards to a show like this, you know what I mean?

Nakku:
The pen name on the next postcard is...
Oh! Tearful Little Diet Girl!
Oh, I remember you!
This is the girl who's been trying every sort of dieting methods under the sun, right?
Apparently, all she does is diet.

Mitchy:
It's not nice to laugh at her, Nakku!
It's a big problem for girls.

Nakku:
Right, right, I shouldn't be laughing about it.
Oh, okay, let's see, the postcard says
"Nakku, Mitchy, please hear this."
"This time, I decided to try out the grainless diet."

Mitchy:
Wow, the grainless diet!

Tomo:
Hey, the grainless diet is the one you tried to follow though with last month and failed at!

Yomi:
Urg...

Tomo:
What's that? Don't tell me...
Hey! A bull's-eye, right?!
Oh, boy! How embarrassing!
You actually send postcards to this kind of show!
Wow, Yomi! This is just too much!
What was that again?
Tearful Little Diet Girl, right?! Oh, sad!

Yomi:
Shut up! Shut up!

Nakku:
"My mother made curry and rice for dinner."
"Having rice for the first time in three days, it was just delicious."
"It was so delicious, I ended up having seconds!"
Hahahaha.
"The next day, when I weighed myself,"
"I weighed more than I had three days ago!"
Of course!
And that she says
"The enemy of the grainless diet was in fact my mother's menu!"

Tomo:
Hahahaha.

Yomi:
Stop laughing!

Tomo:
But you sent it in so people would laugh, right?!

Yomi:
Your laughing in my face is pissing me off!

Nakku:
Eating curry without rice definitely sounds rough.
I'm sorry to hear that, Tearful Little Diet Girl!
Let us know again when you've tried another diet!

Yomi:
I will!

Mitchy:
I'll be rooting for you too!

Yomi:
I'll work hard!

Tomo:
You're an idiot!
Really, Yomi, talking back to the radio!

Yomi:
Shut up!

Tomo:
Whoa, Tearful Little Diet Girl!

Yomi:
What's wrong with that?!

Tomo:
Nothing wrong, it's just too funny!


Sakaki:
Freedom...
What does that mean?

Osaka:
It's freedom, you know...


Nyamo:
Eiko really seemed like she had her stuff together, you know?

Yukari:
Uh? Oh, did she now?

Nyamo:
And those men that Eiko brought along...
I wouldn't be surprised if they thought maybe we were a little too childish.

Yukari:
You think so?

Nyamo:
I don't know.
It's just this feeling I have.

Yukari:
It's probably your imagination.

Nyamo:
I think I might look into an arranged marriage.

Yukari:
An arranged marriage?

Nyamo:
There's been some talk of that sort.

Yukari:
If you want to, why don't you?
It's your life.

Nyamo:
Yeah, you're right. It is my life, isn't it?

Yukari:
So, are you gonna do it or not?

Nyamo:
I don't know.


Tomo:
Why is it that spring always makes you so sleepy?

Yomi:
Could it be because you are always staying up so late!

Nyamo:
Come on, Osaka!
Get it together! Really!
Wah!

Tomo:
Wow!
Fantastic! A fantastic yawn!

Nyamo:
Huh?


-- Preview --

Yukari:
After all's said and done,
I guess those guys are third years now.
/After all is said and done = after all

Nyamo:
It's so fast.
I get the feeling Chiyo-chan's grown quite a bit, too.

Yukari:
Hah! Time flows equally for all people.
Ain't it great?

Nyamo:
Speaking of which, my students gave me a present for my birthday..

Yukari:
Kurosawa, what did you say?!

Nyamo:
Um, a present.

Yukari:
Eek! A present?!
Who cares about birthdays?!
You wanna age that badly?!

Nyamo:
I don't really understand, but things will continue next time.

20-1. Separation
Osaka:
I can't get it off...

Chiyo:
Hello, Miss Osaka, good... good morning.

Osaka:
Oh, Chiyo-chan, you just saved me.

Chiyo:
Today, we're finally third year students.
Let's go do our best!

Osaka:
Oh, yeah!
Our best for sure.

Osaka:
Uh...

Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka:
Not good.
Havin' to go to the third floor everyday, I'm gonna lose heart.

Chiyo:
Boy, that was quick.

Chiyo:
Good morning, everyone!

Osaka:
Mornin' y'all.

Yomi:
Hey, you two!

Osaka:
I guess we're all together again.

Chiyo:
Wait, where are Tomo and Kaorin?

Yomi:
Tomo's coming.
Kaorin went to another class.

Chiyo:
Oh, I see then.
That's too bad.

Tome:
Hey, hey, everyone, good Morning!

Osaka:
Oh!

Chiyo:
Tomo, you cut your hair?

Tomo:
Yup, Just yesterday,
What?
Are the spring fairies themselves bewailed by my graceful new charm?

Chiyo:
Uh...

Tomo:
After all, I've become a third year now.

Chiyo:
But it's like she's reverted to being a first year.

Chiyo:
Oh, did you get dumped by... uh...

Yomi:
Hahaha.
No way, no way!

Chiyo:
I didn't think so.

Chiyo:
Why did you cut all of it off?

Tomo:
Something about this bugs me, but oh well.
Last year, I was growing it out, kinda going for a sexy look, you know.
Basically, I was aiming for the Fujiko look.

Yomi:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Fujiko?

Kagura:
Aim for her look?
But you're not anything like her to begin with.

Tomo:
Well, except for my bust size, I came pretty damn close.

Kagura:
How so?

Tomo:
Lupin!

Everyone:
Ah....

Tomo:
Tha.. that's why I gave up trying to go the Fujiko route!

Kagura:
Yeah.

Tomo:
But at least I could try to shoot for Ayu.

Chiyo;
At least?

Yomi:
Chiyo-chan, it's okay to be angry with her.


Yukari:
I'm Yukari Tanizaki, Class 3 homeroom teacher.
This year, all of you are now studying for entrance exams.
I'm sure it'll be a rough stressful time for you.

Tomo:
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

Yukari:
But it's even rougher on people in the work force.
Don't come looking for pity.



Classmates:
Sigh...



Yukari:
And don't you dare act like you're some tragic victims of the modern education system!

Osaka:
What's her to you?
She seems a little riled up today.

Chiyo:
Really?

Yukari:
I mean, look, if you don't wanna study, then don't go to college.
It's pretty freaking simple.
Huh...

Tomo:
Hey, so did you go to college because you wanted to study?

Yukari:
Hah! You're right like hell.

Osaka:
I wonder if maybe she's got some deep psychological scar.

Chiyo:
Isn't she always like this, though?

Yukari:
Listen up.
You guys have only your own entrance exams to worry about and that's it.
I, on the other hand, have to think about the entrance exams of several dozen people!

Osaka:
I wonder if Yukari is really suited to be a teacher.

Kagura:
Say that and you've left her no hope.

Yukari:
Maybe I just won't think about them...

Chiyo:
Now what were we talking about at the beginning of class...?


Kimura:
I'm Kimura, and I'm the homeroom teacher of Class 4 for this year.
20-2. Yukari's Birthday

Boy:
Congratulations!

Yukari:
Hm?

Students:
Happy birthday!

Nyamo:
What? Really?! Oh, thank you!

Girl
Please will you open it, ma'am.

Nyamo:
Sure.
Uh.

Yukari:
Kurosawa!
What did they get you?

Nyamo:
Handbag...

Yukari:
Wow...
Yeah, well, I've got some handbags of my own!

Nyamo:
I'm sure.

Yukari:
You know, you're better off not having handbags anyway!

Nyamo:
Why is that?

Yukari:
She is a bad person!

Nyamo:
Huh?

Yukari:
I'm an adult, you hear me!
There's nothing fun about birthdays!

Yomi:
Man, even through the wall...

Chiyo:
Now that I think of it, last year was the same.

Yomi:
We didn't get her a gift.

Osaka:
Nyamo, she got somethin' last year too.

Yukari:
What is it, Nyamo?
You're all smiles.

Nyamo:
Huh?
Hang on. See these?
The kids in my class all fetched and gave them to me as a birthday present.
Sometimes I worried that they feel like it's something they have to do.
But it still makes me happy.
What's wrong?

Yukari:
What the hell is with you?!
Do you think you've become the teacher in some youth drama?!

Nyamo:
What are you so mad about?

Osaka:
Yukari's actin' kinda weird today, don't you think.

Kagura:
Yeah, she's never this quiet...

Yukari:
Oh, that's right.
Miss Kurosawa, who teaches next door, apparently got a birthday present from the kids in her class.

Chiyo:
Miss Yukari, so, when is your birthday coming up,

Yukari:
It's already passed.

Tomo:
So, what now?
Yukari's birthday always falls during spring break.

Kagura:
Well, let's get her something, even if it's late.

Yukari:
Who the hell needs presents anyway?!

Everyone:
We're sorry.


Kimura:
Happy birthday, huh?


Yukari:
Good morning.

Chiyo:
Excuse me, Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
Huh?

Chiyo:
We know it's late, but this is a birthday present from all of us in the class.

Yukari:
Huh?
Are, are, are you...
Are you telling me to go give this to Nyamo?!

Chiyo:
No! This is for you, Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
This is a present... for me?

Chiyo:
Mm-hm.

Yukari:
Happy, happy birthday, baby oh,
Happy birthday to me!
Happy, happy birthday, dear Yukari,
Happy freaking birthday to me!

Chiyo:
She is happy, right?

Yomi:
Mm-hm.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Yukari:
Oh, so it's a handbag.
I'm gonna go out for a bit!

Kagura:
She's gone to show it off to Class 2.

Osaka:
Well, you know, it's really great that she's happy 'bout it.


Yukari:
Hm!

Kimura:
It's a happy birthday.
Happy happy birthday.
Oh, happy birthday, Kimurin!

Yukari:
Kimurin?

Kimura:
You look really pretty today.

Yukari:
Okay?
20-3. Flap Your Wings, Chiyo

Tomo:
Ooh, what's that?
Career paths?

Chiyo:
Yes. We are third years, after all.

Kagura:
Mm-hm.
And that is why we're studying for entrance exams.
/That's right, we're students studying for entrance exams now.

Tomo:
Exams?

Kagura:
Yeah, so what about it?

Tomo:
Oh, you're hoping for a sports scholarship?

Kagura:
Shut up!
What are you gonna do for your career?!

Tomo:
Huh? Who me? The ICPO.

Kagura:
The ICPO?

Tomo:
Duh like Interpol!

Kagura
Whoa!

Tomo:
International police!

Kagura:
Whoa, that's crazy!
Are you like a kid or something?!
But does such a thing really exist?
I always thought it was just a movie.

Tomo:
It's not real?!

Chiyo:
Actually, there is an ICPO.

Tomo:
See? It really does exist!

Kagura:
So, how do you go about joining them?

Tomo:
Dunno!

Chiyo:
I wonder though, do you become a police officer first and then you get chosen from there?

Tomo:
What?! Is that how it's supposed to work?!

Chiyo:
I don't know for certain.

Kagura:
For someone, who wants to be a part of it, you should have known much.

Osaka:
I see, Tomo's gonna be a police officer, huh.

Tomo:
Didn't you hear me?
I said, ICPO.

Osaka:
Oh, yeah! Speakin' of police, there's somethin' I've been wonderin' about for long time.

Tomo:
Listen when I'm talking.

Osaka:
Just what do they have written in their police pocketbook?!

Does it have an address book or memo notebook attached to the back or something?

Tomo:
Hey, now that you mention it...

Osaka:
I know it's got the suspect's address and phone number.

Tomo:
Wow, awesome!

Kagura:
Yeah, whatever, dream on!

Tomo:
Well, then...
Maybe it's got a photo of the person they like in there?

Osaka:
A photo of the policewoman they like or print club stickers.

Tomo:
What? A policewoman?!

Osaka:
It'll be rough if a policeman ends up falling for ya.

Tomo,Kagura,Chiyo:
Huh?

Osaka:
You know, they tail people and stuff like that.

Tomo:
That wouldn't be good.

Yomi:
Hey, whatever happened to the ICPO?


Kagura:
Chiyo-chan, you've got a university you like?

Osaka:
Tokyo University?

Chiyo:
Well, actually, I was thinking about flying overseas somewhere.

Kagura:
What? Overseas?

Chiyo:
Yes, I hear that American schools are used to accepting children who have skipped some grades.

Kagura:
Awesome!
You're gonna study abroad, huh?
Sasaki, Ichiro, and next up batter is Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
I say that's a little bit different.

Kagura:
Chiyo-chan's studying abroad.
Amazing?

Tomo:
Mm-hm, Amazing.

Chiyo:
No, really,

Tomo:
She's gonna die.

Osaka:
Hm.

Chiyo:
Ah!

Osaka:
You know, 'cause your family's rich and you're so tiny.
And you're easy to catch.

Kagura:
When you put it that way...

Chiyo:
But if it ever comes to that, Mr. Tadakichi will protect me!

Osaka:
Bang!
Mr. Tadakichi's been shot.

Chiyo:
Ah?!
Then what am I supposed to do after that?

Osaka:
Oh, put your genius to good use like they would in the television drama, make one last futile stand, and then you get killed.

Chiyo:
What?!

Sakaki:
Don't worry.
If it ever comes to that, you can count on your father.

Chiyo:
My father?

Chiyo:
Somebody save me!

Chiyo Papa:
Halt, I say!

Sakaki:
I know he'll fly to your rescue.

Chiyo:
You really think so?

Osaka:
Bang!

Chiyo:
What?! My father too?!

Sakaki:
Don't worry, he deflected the bullets!

Osaka, Chiyo:
What?!
20-4. Child President
Yomi:
But going to study abroad in America?
Have you asked your parents if it's okay?

Chiyo:
Yes. They said it would be good for me to see more of the world.

Osaka:
Let your darlin' children go travel.

Chiyo:
Hm?

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, you're darlin'.
Travel's okay!

Chiyo:
Hahaha...

Tomo:
All right, since you're doing this, let's make you president!

Chiyo:
That's not possible.

Tomo:
We'll make America Chiyo-chan's country!
When you are Pres. give me Hawaii.

Chiyo:
Like I said, it's not possible.

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan's own country, huh?
I'd wanna visit some time.

Yomi:
I bet she's thinking something weird again.
Uh?

Osaka:
Uh, so, this is America!

Chiyo:
Hello!
Hello there! Hello there! Hello there! Hello there!
Welcome to our country!
Welcome!

Osaka:
I just can't believe how cute all the little bitty Chiyo-chans are.

Chiyo:
We'll carry your luggage!
We will! We will!

Osaka:
Are you sure?
Thanks a whole lot!

Chiyo:
Let's be on our way!
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

Osaka:
That'd be nice...


Chiyo:
Oh, was it okay for us to let Miss Osaka go like that?

Yomi:
She probably won't be back for a while.

Tomo:
Mm-hm.

Chiyo:
Oh, their pork buns are supposed to be delicious!

Yomi, Tomo:
Huh?

Yomi:
Well, if anyone knows about good food.

Tomo:
What about pizza buns or gratin buns?

Chiyo:
They only sell pork buns!

Tomo:
Yes! I think I'll buy a snack for the trip home!
Wow, that was fast!

Tomo:
Hey...

Yomi:
What do you want?

Tomo:
Oh, nothing, nothing.

Yomi:
They don't use sugar or stuff in pork buns, so it's okay.

Tomo:
Well, well, how convenient for you, huh.

Oh, yummy!

Chiyo:
It sure is delicious!

Tomo:
It's gotta be 100% beef all the way!

Yomi:
Pork, dummy!

Chiyo:
That was really tasty.

Yomi:
You just can't beat a good pork bun.

Tomo:
Yeah, well, I couldn't live without octopus buns.

Chiyo:
I've never had that kind of bun.
Do they actually have those?

Tomo:
These days, they have everything.
So, what's your favourite food, Chiyo-chan? Shark fins?
They have shark fin buns.

Chiyo:
Let's see...

Oh, I like meatballs!

Tomo:
Uh-oh, we've got a kid here!

Chiyo:
I am not a kid!

Tomo:
You're a kid, you're a kid! You're a real little kid!

Chiyo:
Then, what kind of food do you like?!

Tomo:
Hm?
Ah, bananas, I guess.

Yomi:
Whoa, there's a moron here!

Tomo:
Why... Why do you say that?!

Miruchi, Yuka:
Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Huh?
Miruchi! Yuka!

Yomi:
Who are they?

Chiyo:
My classmates from back in grade school.

Miruchi, Yuka:
Good afternoon.

Yomi:
Wow, so, you would be in middle school already.

Chiyo:
What are you saying?
I'm a high school student.

Miruchi:
Guess what?
Now, we've got our own sailor uniforms to wear.

Chiyo:
Wow! I never got to wear those.
You're so lucky.

Yuka:
But I'll never get to wear the uniform you're wearing either because your school is tough to get in.

Miruchi:
You really must be very good at school.

Tomo:
Mm-hm.

Yomi, Chiyo:
Wha..?!

Yomi:
Our school allows for quite a bit of freedom, so we do get people who skip classes and fail out too.

Yuka:
Yeah?

Tomo:
Hey, don't look at me.

Yomi:
Some even get into Tokyo University, and another can't get in anywhere.

Tomo:
Hey, don't look at me.

Chiyo:
Hm...

Miruchi
Bye-bye!

Yuka:
See you later!

Chiyo:
Bye-bye!

Thanks for waiting.

Tomo:
You weren't talking about...

Yomi:
I was.


20-5. Please Be Strong
Kimura:
Now, for this part...
Um... you Kaorin,

Kaorin:
Would you please not call me that?

Kimura:
But that's what everyone calls you...

Kaorin:
Then why am I the only one in class being called by a nickname?!

Kimura:
Um... okay, from now on, you may call me Kimurin.
How's that?

Kaorin:
That's not my point!

Yomi:
Just like that you became the class Rep?

Kaorin:
More like I was made to than really became...

Yomi:
What? Like bullying?

Kaorin:
No, I think... just the opposite.

Yomi:
Huh?

Boy:
Well, since we still don't have any candidates so far, we should go ahead make nominations.
So, can anybody think of someone they'd like to nominate?

Kimura:
Me! I think Kaorin would do a great job!

Any more nominees?

Kaorin:
You see, Kimura likes me!

Yomi:
It's worse than I thought!

Kaorin:
So, I'm stuck with him for the entire year...
Huh?
Miss Sakaki still is cool as ever!

But why? Why am I the only one who's in a different class?!

Sakaki:
I got to see you again today.
I'm so happy.

Kaorin:
Why? Why am I the only one who's in a different class?!
Everybody...

Kimura's wife:
Excuse me...

Kaorin:
Huh? Ah!

Kimura's wife:
I'm sorry.
Could you please give me directions to the faculty office?

Kaorin:
It's Kimura's wife.

Kimura's wife:
I apologise, see the thing is, my husband left his lunch at home again.
I guess he's rather absentminded.

Kaorin:
The "love wife lunch"!

Kimura's wife:
I've come here before, but I always seem to forget no matter how hard I try.

Kaorin:
To get to the faculty office, go in there, go up the stairs, and it's at the back of the second floor.

Kimura's wife:
Thank you.

Kaorin:
Mm-hm.

Kimura's wife:
Aw!

Kaorin:
Such a good person.
Yes, that's right.
If he has a good person like her for a wife, then Mr. Kimura must have his good points too.

Kaorin:
I've got a whole year with him as my homeroom teacher, so I'm gonna find those good points!
Huh?

Kaorin:
Tending a garden?
He's never shown a side like that before.
Hm?

Kimura:
Oh, hello there, Kaorin.

Kaorin:
Ah, hi!
So, you like gardening, Mr. Kimura?
What kind of flower...
Ah!

Kaorin:
Good points...
Good points...
Like hell I'm gonna find any!

Tomo:
Next episode is the school trip to Okinawa!

Osaka:
Shiisaa.

Chiyo:
This will be my first time, so I'm really excited!

Osaka:
Saataa andajii.

Kagura:
I've got my sights set on scuba diving.

Osaka:
Bitter melon champloo.

Sakaki:
I might see an iriomote cat.

Osaka:
Yamapikayaa!

Tomo:
Okay, all together now...

Everyone:
Haisai!

21-1. Anticipation
Yukari:
Now, on next month's schedule is the long awaited school trip.
Are you looking forward to it, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Hahaha...

Yukari:
Well, that's too bad, because the trip's been cancelled.

Chiyo:
Ahh!

Yukari:
I'm kidding, that was a lie.
She looks so happy, I just couldn't help myself.

Tomo:
Ma'am! I understand.

Yukari:
All right, I've got a guidebook for school trips here.
Let me read a little to you.
Um, "The school trip is not simply an excuse to have fun."
"Be fully aware that it is an important supplement to your studies."
It says that, but we know better right?

Yomi, Tomo:
Mm-hm.

Yukari:
But don't think it's gonna be easy!
Having fun in a town you don't know in a short amount of time may be harder than you realize.
Some of you are sure to end your trip with regrets.
But you can't say I didn't warn you!
Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha Ha....

Chiyo:
Finally, it's our class's school trip!
This will be my first school trip ever!

Yomi:
Oh, that's right.
You left before you finished grade school, didn't you?

Chiyo:
Uh-huh.

Tomo:
Very well.
Then, I will teach you the rules of going on school trips.

Chiyo:
What rules?

Tomo:
You must buy a wooden sword as a souvenir.

Chiyo:
A wooden sword?!

Tomo:
And a Shinsen(gumi) livery coat to go with it.

Chiyo:
A coat?!
A coat...

Yomi:
Chiyo-chan...

Osaka:
Hey, we gotta make a decision on our group.

Chiyo:
Huh! She said it was six people to a group, right?

Osaka:
Mm-hm.

Yomi:
Then, that's me, Chiyo-chan and Osaka...

Chiyo:
Yes!

Yomi:
Sakaki and Kagura...

Kagura:
Hm?

Yomi:
We can have one group with just five people, can't we?

Tomo:
Hey, hey, that's harsh, senor.

Yomi:
Do you wanna take a look at the guidebook?

Chiyo:
Okay!
Wow!
Oh, I can't wait till we get there!

Osaka:
Uh-huh, I bet it'll be tons of fun.

Chiyo:
Yup, it sure will!

Tomo:
At that time, they never would've dreamed it would turn out to be such a miserable trip.
Or something.

Yomi:
Enough with the narration!

Chiyo:
So excited, so excited! One month to go!

Tomo:
Yeah, what?

Yomi:
Hello?

Tomo:
Yomi?

Yomi:
Tomo, it's almost time for Okinawa.

Tomo:
Ah!

Yukari:
So, is everyone here?!
If you're not, raise your hand!
Ahaha, Just kidding!

Tomo:
Me! I'm not here, ma'am!

Yukari:
But you are!
Now, I know that our destination is Okinawa.
But the trip is from now till we get home!

Tomo:
Ooh! Airport souvenirs!

Yomi:
Whoa, you're buying already?!

Nyamo:
Slow down, huh.


Kagura:
Oh...
I'm starting to get a little nervous.

Tomo:
Hm, with this many people, we might not be able to get off the ground.

Tomo, Kagura:
Ah!

Kagura:
It's gonna take off!

Tomo:
Captain?!

Tomo, Kagura:
Wow! Ahhhh!

Kagura:
Incredible power!

Tomo:
This maybe can fly! We can fly!

Tomo, Kagura:
Ahhhh!

Yomi:
Shut up.
21-2. Can't Stand Still

Tomo:
Okinawa...
Okinawa!
Ahhh!
The sky's so blue!
Ahhh!
Let's move it!

Yukari:
Just stay cool.

Chiyo:
Haisai!
Hahaha...

Osaka:
Oh, that's Okinawan, huh.

Chiyo:
Haisai!

Osaka:
That means "Hello," doesn't it?

Chiyo:
Ow!
Yes, what?

Tomo:
What do you say in Okinawan in times like that?

Chiyo:
Times like that?

Tomo:
Yeah.

Chiyo:
Ow, ow!
I believe they say "Agaa!"

Tomo:
Hmm...

Chiyo:
Ow!


Kagura:
Ooh, so this is the Shureimon Gate.

Tomo:
Yeah, I bet money on it.

Chiyo:
It is the gate.

Kagura:
Oh, wow! A 2,000 yen bill!
Cool...

Yomi:
Wow.

Osaka:
You're right, it looks exactly like it.

Chiyo:
The Shureimon Gate is also in the watermark.

Kagura:
Huh?

Chiyo:
It is!

Everyone:
Oh...

Osaka:
Oh, they got shiisaa here!
Hey, Chiyo-chan, how would you ask someone in Okinawan.
Is that a shiisaa?

Chiyo:
"A-re shiisaa yaibiimi?", yeah.

Osaka:
Shiisaa yaibiimi?

Chiyo:
Uree shiisaa yaibiin.

Chiyo:
Six high school students, please!

Tomo:
Yeah! Let's go!
Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa!
Boom, boom!

Osaka:
Wow...
They got shiisaa lined up here too.
Let's see, um...
Shiisaa yaibiin.
Shiisaa yaibiin.
Shiisaa yaibiimi?

Chiyo:
A-re shiisaa aibiran!

Everyone:
Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa!
Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa!
Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa! Okinawa!

Yomi:
Shut up.

Tomo:
It's the hotel!

Kagura:
Yeah!

Tomo:
It's dinner time!

Osaka, Chiyo:
Yeah!

Tomo:
Buffet!
It's a Buffet!

Yomi:
Limiter override!

Tomo:
Oh, it's on!

Yomi:
I'm gonna eat this. And I'm gonna eat this too!

Tomo:
There! And there, and there, and there!

Osaka:
Ooh, this is all champloo, right?

Chiyo:
Right.
We're in Okinawa, so this is required eating!

Osaka:
Yeah.
Bitter melon champloo.
Wheat-gluten bread champloo.
Fine noodle champloo.
Let's see, let's see, let's see...

Chiyo:
Hm?

Osaka:
Let's see, let's see...
Champloo!
21-3. Watery Grave

Yomi:
First, Shurijo Castle, now Manzamou.
I sure am glad we're getting to hit all the highlights.

Kagura:
Yahoo!

Chiyo:
The cliffs and the sea...
It's just so terrifying!

Tomo:
Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
Uh...

Tomo:
Up we go!

Yomi:
Tomo, cut it out!

Kagura:
Chiyo-chan!

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan!

Kagura:
Moron!

Tomo:
Man, that was terrifying!

Yomi:
Chill out, Osaka, it's over.

Osaka:
Huh?

Yukari:
Your attention please!
Recreational diving is up next!
For this activity, I'll be joining for it with your group, okay?

Everyone:
Yeah!

Yukari:
This is my first time!
I'm super stoked!
How about you, huh?

Chiyo:
Oh, I've actually done it before, but you know...

Yukari:
Come on, let's toss this brat into the sea!
And a one, and a two...

Yukari, Tomo:
The ocean, the ocean, the ocean,
ocean, ocean, ocean!

Kagura:
Wow, that was really fun!

Sakaki:
Yeah.

Tomo:
Yeah! It was like super fun!

Kagura:
Are you kidding?!
"Super" can't even start to describe it!
No, the word is... awesome...

Chiyo:
Huh?

Kagura:
It was awesome fun!


Tomo:
What should I get for a souvenir?

Tomo:
Chinsuko!

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
It's chinsuko!

Yomi:
Are you gonna buy it?

Tomo:
It's chinsuko!
It's chinsuko!
Chinsuko!
See, chinsuko!
Chinsuko!

Yomi:
Just shut up...

Sakaki:
Hm...

Chiyo:
Oh, these little shiisaa are so cute!

Sakaki:
Huh!
Those ARE really nice.

Chiyo:
Each of their faces is just a little bit different, so they really have that handmade feel.

Sakaki:
This one. No way, this one?

Chiyo:
I'm gonna get this one!

Sakaki:
Huh!

Osaka:
Shiisaa yaibiin.

Chiyo:
Huh?
Miss Osaka! Miss Kagura!

Kagura:
Yo.

Osaka:
Hey, Chiyo-chan!


Yomi:
Hey, what's the matter?

Tomo:
It smells good.

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
Sniff, sniff, sniff...

Yomi:
What are you doing now?

Tomo:
Oh!

Chiyo:
Tomo!

Kagura:
Yo!

Osaka:
Hahaha...

Tomo:
Ooh, what's that? Something sweet?!

Osaka:
Saataa andagii.

Tomo:
Candy?!

Chiyo:
I'm sorry, we didn't buy any for you two...

Osaka:
Saataa andagii.

Tomo:
How much was it?

Chiyo:
100 yen.

Osaka:
Saataa andagii.

Tomo:
Where did you get it?

Osaka:
Saataa andagii.

Tomo:
Oh, shut up! Man!

Osaka:
Saataa andagii.

Tomo:
So, like I said!

Osaka:
Saataa andagii.

Kagura:
What's that?

Yomi:
Oh, this is...

Tomo, Osaka:
Saataa andagii!

Yomi:
No, it's not!
21-4. Island of Dreams
Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki!
Hey, good morning!

Sakaki:
Morning.

Kaorin:
So, which island are you going to for the day trip?
We're going to Miyakojima Island.

Sakaki:
I'm going... to Iriomote cat!

Kaorin:
Huh? Oh, Iriomote Island.
I hope you enjoy it!

Sakaki:
I will.
Ah...

Kaorin:
Uh... What?

Sakaki:
That t-shirt...

Kaorin:
Oh, I bought it at a shop over there.

Sakaki:
No, no, look there...

Kaorin:
Huh?

Kimura:
Uh...

Kaorin:
I'm gonna go change!

Sakaki:
Uh...


Tomo:
Oh, wow! I see it! I see it!

Chiyo:
I'll go over the plan one more time, okay?

Yomi:
Sure.

Chiyo:
We'll take a walk from Ohara Harbor, go to the Wildlife Center, go all the way around to get on a tour boat, go down to Urauchigawa River, and see the Mariyudo Waterfall.
After that, we'll buy souvenirs at Uebara and go home.

Yomi:
Well, in any case, let's be careful not to miss the boat back to the main island.

Chiyo:
Yes, of course.

Osaka:
Wow, so that's it...
the island...

Tomo:
Iriomote!

Yomi:
Everyone, ready?

Chiyo:
I'll take one with you.

Yomi:
Wildcat...
Wildcat...

Tomo:
"Wildcat area. Please take care and slow down."
Hear that? Wildcats!

Kagura:
Oh, that's awesome!

Osaka:
Well, then, we better do what it says and slow down too.

Yomi:
You should be fine...

Tomo:
You think we'll see an iriomote cat?!

Sakaki:
Uh-uh, it's probably impossible.

Tomo:
Hm?

Sakaki:
I know I really shouldn't be getting my hopes up.
Not to mention these are wildcats.
I might not get off so easy.

Chiyo:
Let's hope they have some cute wildcat stuff at a gift shop.

Sakaki:
Yes.

Tomo:
Oh, man, so we're not gonna get to see any?

Kagura:
Well, with Sakaki here, we might be able to get one to bite if she stuck her hand out.

Sakaki:
Like this?

Hm! Ah...

Osaka:
Sakaki is just like a frog bein' stared down by a snake.

Tomo:
Well, you know the drill, Kagura!

Kagura:
Roar!

Chiyo:
No, wait you guys!

Everyone:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Those somewhat tiger-like features!
The short legs and a thick tail!
Those two rounded ears!
And the mottled pattern on its fur!
Yamapikaryaa!
21-5. Cat of the Mountains
Yomi:
Yamapikaryaa?

Chiyo:
Yes.
Yamapikaryaa is how they refer to iriomote cats in the local language!

Osaka:
Yamapikaryaa?

Chiyo:
Mm-hm.

Yomi:
Huh...

Kagura:
What the...?

Sakaki:
Ah!

Chiyo:
Oh, he's taken a liking to Miss Sakaki!

Everyone:
Wow!

Kagura:
Hey, you can pet him!

Tomo:
All right, Sakaki, go for it!

Kagura:
Yeah, pick him up! Big hug!

Kagura, Tomo:
Go!

Chiyo:
He's so cute! He's still a kitten, isn't he?

Sakaki:
Yamamayaa.
Yamamayaa!

Chiyo:
Yamamayaa also means wildcat!

Osaka:
Uh-huh.

Osaka:
Yamapikaryaa!
Yamapikaryaa!

Chiyo:
I guess he'll look like that when he grows up too, huh.

Sakaki:
Mm-hm.

Osaka:
And then, look like that.

Chiyo:
Ah....

Osaka:
Well, talk about all bony.

Kagura:
Oh, there's a snake swimming!

Tomo:
Oh, no way!

Tomo, Kagura:
Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!


Chiyo:
I guess it's goodbye.

Sakaki:
In the end, I know we really shouldn't take him home with us.
I can't keep cats at home, so...
Not to mention the fact that you're a special national monument.
You can't come with us!

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki...

Sakaki:
The mother cat?


Tomo:
Huh? Airport souvenir...

Spice Tea! Turmeric!
Spice Tea, spice Tea, spice Tea, spice Tea, spice Tea, spice Tea!

Yomi:
Shut up!

Chiyo:
Okinawa certainly was fun!

Osaka:
It sure was, wasn't it?

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Hm?

Chiyo:
Wouldn't it be nice to come back, tee-hee?

Sakaki:
Yeah.
One day, I will.


-- Preview --

Yukari:
It's coming, it's coming. It's creeping up.
Look, it's almost here.

Osaka:
Huh? What? Something's comin'?

Yukari:
What do you think?!
Entrance exams! College entrance exams!

Osaka:
Where? Where's it comin'?

Tomo:
Let's go to Chiyo-chan's summer home again this year!
This time will be an entrance exam study camp!
We'll swim! We'll have fun!
We'll smash watermelons!

Yukari:
Never mind that! Study!

22-1. It's Nice
Osaka:
Summer's here.

Kagura:
Hm? Wha-What?

Osaka:
You're tanned.
When you're tanned through and through like that, it's hard to tell just how tanned you are.

Kagura:
Oh, in that case, then here. See?

Osaka:
That imprint in your swimsuit.
You know, with that, you could go to the pool wearin' nothin' and no one would even notice that something was missing.

Kagura:
Uh...

Yomi:
Kagura, don't listen to her!


Yukari:
It's hot! It's summer!

Tomo:
Summer means...

Yukari:
Starting tomorrow is happy summer break.

Everyone:
Yay! Yay!

Tomo:
All right! It's summer time!
I'm keeping with our summer custom.

Chiyo:
Huh?

Tomo:
So can we take another trip to your summer home this year?

Chiyo:
That's fine, but won't everyone be studying for entrance exams now?

Yukari:
Hm?

Tomo:
Then, let's make it an exams study camp all right?
Let's get away from the din of the city and focus on our studies somewhere quiet!

Chiyo:
Oh, that's a great idea!

Yomi:
Don't let her fool you, Chiyo-chan.

Yukari:
Ha ha ha ha...


Kagura, Tomo, Osaka:
Hey, there!

Chiyo:
Hey, you guys, we've been waiting for you!

Tomo:
And joining us for the first time, here's Kaorin!
Huh?

Kaorin:
Um...

I hope we'll get along!

Sakaki:
Mm-hm.

Kaorin:
Even though I'm not worthy!

Sakaki:
Uh-huh.

Nyamo:
All right then, we have a total of nine people.
And we'll be splitting up into two cars.

Yomi:
There's nine of us?
Two cars?
No, no way...

Yu... Yukari-mobile...

Kaorin:
What are you talking about?

Kagura:
That's the car that psychologically scarred Chiyo-chan two years ago.

Kaorin:
Ah! Psychologically scarred?!

Osaka:
Ah! Chiyo-chan already made it safe to Miss Nyamo's car!

Kaorin:
What kind of driving are we talking about?

Kagura:
So, what now?

Osaka:
Which of us is gonna have to ride with Miss Yukari in her car?

Yomi:
Well, um, I guess Chiyo-chan's excused...

Kaorin:
I... I don't handle riding in cars well, so could I...

Sakaki:
Fine, I'll ride with her.

Kaorin:
Ahhh.
I hope I'll go too.

Osaka:
Y'all are so cool.

Tomo:
All right! Go, Yukari!

Yukari:
Yeah!

Kaorin:
Wha... What just happened here?!

Yukari:
Okay, that was really weird.
Oh?

Kaorin:
What is it?

Yukari:
Sorry, I must've been in reverse, huh.

Tomo:
Man, you're so bad, Yukari!

Go, Yukari!

Yukari:
Yeah!

Tomo:
Come on! Pass the Nyamo-mobile!

Osaka:
It sounds funny.
Huh?

Tomo:
Hey! What did you stop for?!

Yukari, Tomo:
Looser! Looser!

Kaorin:
It's red! Ahhh!

Osaka:
Ooh, they're flyin'.
22-2. Fooled
Yukari:
Safe arrival!

Tomo:
Yay! We are here.

Yomi:
Yeah, yeah, we are here.

Sakaki:
Are you okay?

Kaorin:
The nice thing about roller coasters is they don't get into collisions...

Yukari:
Huh?
The side mirror was in the whole time.

Kaorin:
Ah!

Osaka:
Lazy, lazy.

Kaorin:
I had no idea going to the beach would involve such suffering.

Tomo:
Yay! We're here, we're really here!

Yomi:
Yes, yes, we get it.

Chiyo:
Everyone, once we've rested, let's get right on down...

Tomo:
To the beach!

Chiyo:
The beach already?!

Yomi:
You're not in grade school.
Don't wear your swimsuit under your clothes.

Chiyo:
Isn't this trip supposed to be a study camp?

Tomo:
I lied!

Chiyo:
What?! So bluntly?!

Yukari,Nyamo:
Uh...

Tomo:
No dice?


Tomo:
Whee!
Yay! The ocean, the ocean!

Yomi:
Yeah, yeah, it's the ocean.

Tomo:
Huh?

Yomi, Kagura, Chiyo, Sakaki:
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.

Kaorin:
I had no idea not being able to swim because motion sickness would be such a hardship...

Osaka:
Ha-ha-ha-ha...
Hot, hot! Hot, hot! Hot, hot, hot, hot!
It's just too hot.

Sakaki:
You might get burns on your feet today if you don't wear your sandals.

Tomo:
Yay! Watermelon, watermelon!

Osaka:
So nice...

Sakaki:
Mm...

Tomo:
Totally, I'd sure like to know those measurements.
Though, I've also been growing quite a bit lately.

Osaka:
What? Aren't you one of us?

Tomo:
Oh, I am one of you!

Chiyo:
I got you! I got you, got you guys!

Yomi:
Take that! And that!

Kagura:
But is it really okay for us to be goofing off like this instead of studying?

Tomo:
C'mon! You're way too serious, Kagura!
Of course, you shouldn't goof off!
But let's goof off!

Kagura:
You're amazing.

Nyamo:
Just keep the two apart.
Focus on studying when you study, focus on fun when you're on a break.

Tomo:
You heard her?
This camp is going be for goofing off only.

Nyamo:
No, it's not!

Yukari:
Sure, it is. Keep goofing off.

Tomo:
See? It's got our teacher's stamp of approval!

Yukari:
Even if you did study, you wouldn't be ready in time for the entrance exams anyway, so...

Kagura, Tomo:
Huh?

Tomo:
Really?
22-3. Miss Kurosawa
Everyone:
The food was great!

Osaka:
Oh, yeah, lazy, lazy.

Chiyo:
Okay, everyone, now that we've all had dinner, why don't we...

Tomo:
Yay! It's bed time, bed time!

Yukari:
Yes, by all means, go to bed!

Tomo:
Really?

Yukari:
If there's anything you don't get, don't hesitate to ask someone.

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Kaorin:
Um, Excuse me, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Um...

Kaorin:
Um...

Kagura:
Oh, yay. Study, study...

Kagura:
I gotta be ready. Please let me be ready!

Yomi:
You two are both so noisy.
Why don't you take a cue from Osaka.

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka is incredibly focused today, isn't she?

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, explain this part to me.

Chiyo:
O-Okay.

Osaka:
Hey, Yomi, explain this part to me.

Yomi:
S-Sure.

Osaka:
Miss Yukari, explain this...

Yukari:
Are you really thinking at all?

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, if you stay down there, you're going to fall asleep again.

Osaka:
Hehehe...

Yukari:
If there's anything you don't get, don't hesitate to ask someone.

Everyone:
Yes, ma'am!

Kagura:
Hey, did you get this part at all?

Tomo:
Oh, yay. Study, study.

Kagura:
Yukari, explain this part to me.

Yukari:
If you don't get it, don't hesitate to ask someone.

Kagura:
Coach, explain this part to me!

Nyamo:
Huh? Me explain?!

Nyamo:
Ma... Math... Well... um...
Uh, let me think...
What to say... What to say...

Osaka:
Ya got it wrong.

Nyamo:
Give me a second!

Nyamo:
I... wrong... yet...
It...It's just taking me a while to find the words... yeah, yeah, the words.
So, you understand, I... I-I mean I could do it back in school!
It's sure, it really is! I'm telling you the truth, I promise!

Kagura:
So you really don't get it, huh?

Nyamo:
Well, I...
That is to say...
I really don't get it at all.

Yukari:
Come on, be nice to your poor dumb P.E. teacher,

Yukari:
I'm not dumb! Listen, Yukari!

Yukari:
Regarding shame, in a cultural idiosyncratic way, most Japanese treat this issue.
I have to say, unlike my coward, I am not gripped by it, but merely fascinated.

Nyamo:
Everyone, don't let her fool you!
Just 'cause she's a teacher of language, it doesn't make her great or anything!

Kagura:
Yukari is so much more...
Much greater...

Nyamo:
No, girls, don't be fooled by her words! Don't let her fool you!

Hey, isn't it time for break now?
Look, look, do you girls know how to juggle?

Chiyo:
Ah!

Yukari:
What are you interfering with their studies for?!

Nyamo:
Ahhh!

Chiyo:
Um, uh, would you please teach me how to juggle?

Nyamo:
It's okay, you don't have to be so nice.

Chiyo:
Ye... Yes, ma'am.

Nyamo:
It's cold...
Is it morning?
Hm? Where'd this blanket...? Huh?
22-4. An Attempt

Chiyo:
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
One, two, three...

Nyamo:
Honestly, I don't know if she's like a child or an old man.

Kaorin:
Oh, Chiyo-chan, what's that?

Chiyo:
A stamp book.
Miss Kurosawa made it special for me.
She said she'll stamp it for me every morning that I do radio warm-ups.

Kaorin:
Lucky you!

Sakaki:
Radio warm-ups?

Chiyo:
Huh? Ah!

Sakaki:
A stamp every morning...
Huh?

Kaorin:
Taking a snapshot! Please act normal!

Sakaki:
Uh, sure...

Kaorin
Please relax, relax!

Sakaki:
Uh...

Kaorin:
Say cheese!

Kaorin:
Damn it!

Tomo:
Oh...

Chiyo, Sakaki:
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight!
One, two...

Kaorin:
I had no idea getting up this early could be such a wonderful thing.

Tomo:
Cheese!

Kaorin:
Damn it!

Tomo:
Wow!

Osaka:
Whoa! She's flyin'.


Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Osaka, you're awake.

Osaka:
Yeah...

Chiyo:
Now, the only one still sleeping is Miss Yukari.

Yomi:
But I have a feeling she'll get mad so I can't bring myself to wake her.

Osaka:
Uh...
Then, you just let me handle it for you, okay?
It's been my dream...
I've always wanted to try wakin' someone with a fryin' pan.

Yomi:
Hm? Ah!

Yukari:
Oh, it's you, Osaka.

Kagura:
Oh, man, you splattered everywhere!

Yukari:
Wha... What?

Osaka:
Ya woke up yourself...
Then I failed...

Chiyo:
Mi-Miss Osaka, what in the world are you carrying around?!

Osaka:
Huh? Wh-What? I was holdin' a fryin' pan just a minute ago.
Where'd it go?

Chiyo:
Ah, Miss Osaka, please don't swing it this way!

Osaka:
Do you know what happened, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Please don't swing it around! Ahh!

Yukari:
Kni... knife flying...
22-5. It's Not Over Yet
Osaka:
Once again, summer break is over.

It's autumn.

Kagura:
Autumn?

Osaka:
And autumn means chestnut rice.

Kagura:
Huh?

Osaka:
Broiled saury is good too.
Do you have char marks like a broiled saury?

Kagura:
Huh?
What? Are you kidding?
Don' be silly!

Osaka:
Saury with rice, two big course.

Yomi:
Kagura, don't listen to her!

Chiyo:
Tomo, what's the matter?
Your eyes look so dead.

Tomo:
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.
Summer break will pick up again after today.
Let's all go together to the blue, blue sea.
Smashing watermelons, beach volleyball...
It'll be so much fun, will never leave.
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.

Chiyo:
Please get a hold of yourself!
The second semester starts today!

Osaka:
Tomo, get a hold of yourself!
It ain't a summer service day.

Tomo:
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.

We're still in the middle of summer break, you know?
Let's all go together to the blue, blue sea.
Smashing watermelons, beach volleyball...
It'll be so much fun, won't you join me?

Osaka, Tomo:
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.
Today is a summer service day.

Chiyo:
No, you're wrong!

Osaka, Tomo:
Chiyo-chan, please cast a charm on us that'll get us motivated.

Chiyo:
Ca... Cast a charm?

Chiyo:
Huh...
Get motivated!

Kagura:

Let me show you how to do it!
Motivation slap!

Chiyo:
Ah!

Kagura:
Oh, are you okay?!

Kamineko:
Mew.

Chiyo:
Uh...
Get motivated! Get motivated!
Get motivated! Get motivated!
Get motivated! Get motivated!
Get motivated! Get motivated!
Get motivated! Get motivated!
Get motivated! Get motivated!
Get motivated! Get...

Oh! Get motivated! Get motivated!

-- Preview --

Kagura:
We're finally in our third year!
The last sports fest in high school!
All right, let's do it again this year!

Osaka:
What're we doin' for our third year?
Is there gonna be some conspicuous distinction?

Kagura:
Distinction?
But we're gonna be doing the same thing!

Osaka:
Which scene should we keep our eye on?

Kagura:
Um, the bread eating contest, I guess.

Osaka:
Then, which one should we keep our ear on, our mouth, and our nose?

Kagura:
I have no idea what you are talking about.
Anyway, let's get fired up!

23-1. Got a Bite
Kagura, Tomo:
Let's eat!

Kagura:
Many thanks for the food!

Tomo:
Many thanks for the...

Kagura:
I won!

Tomo:
I lost.

Tomo:
What gives, Osaka?
Are you really still eating?

Kagura:
Man, You're slow.

Yomi:
No, it's you guys that are too fast.

Osaka:
Mm-hm.

Chiyo:
Oh, hey, everyone!

Everyone:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Look I have the printouts for the sports fest here.
And it looks like they completely change the events for this year.

Osaka:
Ah!

Chiyo:
Ah!

Tomo:
O... Osa...

Osaka:
Brea..!
Bread... eatin'... con!
Bread eatin' con! Bread eatin' con! Bread eatin' con!
Bread eatin' con! Bread eatin' con!

Yomi:
Oh.

Tomo:
Bean paste...

Osaka:
Is there a bread eatin' contest?!

Chiyo:
Oh... Bread eating contest?
Oh! There is! There really is a bread eating contest!
You see.

Osaka:
There's a bread eatin' contest!
I better start practicin' for it right away.
And I gotta a sweet bean bun right here!

Oh, shoot, there's no string.

Yomi:
Really, now...

Osaka:
Ahhhh.

Huh...

Chiyo:
Hm...

Osaka:
Ah...

Chiyo:
Hm...

Kagura:
What're you guys doing?

Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Kagura.

Osaka:
After my first failure, I came prepared this time.
A sweet bean bun and a big ball of string.

Kagura:
Right.

Osaka:
But you know...
Uh...
How are you supposed to hang up the bread?

Chiyo:
Do you just tie it around the bun?

Kagura:
No. Isn't it more like... more like bait?
You know, with a fish hook?

Osaka:
Ah!

I had no idea it was so dangerous!

Kagura:
Nah, I guess not.

Chiyo:
Oh!

Tomo:
Oh, Yukari!
If we win this year, you treat us to juice!

Yukari:
Do you honestly love juice that much, Tomo?

Tomo:
Uh...
If you're asking if I want it that badly, then no, not really, but...
Who cares?!
You're making a bet!
You're gonna turn a profit, right?!

Yukari:
Even when I profit, it's not like it's for real.

Tomo:
Huh? What are you saying then?

Yukari:
To put it simply...

Osaka:
Huh?

Yukari:
Osaka, come here for a sec.
Osaka will be Mr. Yukichi.

Osaka:
Mr. Yukichi?

Yukari:
Mr. Yukichi.

Osaka:
Mr. Yukichi.

Yukari:
If we win the sports fest, I get Osaka!

Tomo:
Huh?

Yomi:
I don't really get it, but whatever.

Yukari:
Victory! I got Osaka!

Osaka:
I've been got.

Yukari:
But soon after, Osaka would leave to be with Nyamo.
Bye-bye.

Osaka:
Bye-bye.

Yukari:
See?!
Now, isn't that the lonely?

Tomo:
So... so, in other words,

Yukari:
Oh...

23-2. Motivator
Kagura:
All right!
The sports fest is tomorrow!

Tomo:
Wow! You're fired up!

Kagura:
Oh, yeah! Sports are my specialty!
Just leave it to me!

Tomo:
I've got high hopes for you!

Kagura:
All this talk is getting me fired up!
I'm gonna do it this year!

Yomi:
Getting fired up is fine, but give us a hand, would ya?
We won't make it in time if we don't all help out.

Tomo:
Ooh, a tent?

Kagura:
A tent! A tent!

Tomo:
Okay, what should I do?!

Kagura:
And me, what about me?

Chiyo:
Tomo, please support that pole and Miss Kagura, please take hold of this side.

Tomo:
Right! let's go!

Kagura:
It's on now!

Yomi:
Okay, let's raise it up!

Chiyo:
Yeah.

Tomo:
Boom! Boom! Boom!

Kagura:
You wanna fight?!

Yomi:
Hey, quit goofing off!

Kagura:
Attack!

Chiyo:
Ah!

Yomi:
Uwa...

Chiyo:
Just when we thought we finally got it set up...

Kagura:
I'm sorry. We were fooling...

Tomo:
Oh, Kagura, she wrecked the tent!
Wrecked the tent, Wrecked the tent! Lalala...
Everybody was working so hard at it and Kagura had to go and mess it all up!

Kagura:
Oh...
Boo-hoo...

Tomo:
Uh, what's wrong?
Hey, Kagura...

Kagura:
Chiyo-chan, I'm sorry.
You were all working on it and I just...

Chiyo:
Oh, oh no, it's okay.

Kagura:
Why am I such a lousy no-good bumbling idiot?
I'll take care of the rest of it by myself.

Tomo:
Tha... That isn't how it goes!
You're supposed to take a jab at me!
You know, say something like "It was totally Tomo's fault!"
Not go off getting all serious and stuff!

Chiyo:
Miss Kagura.

Kagura:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Why don't we all set it up together?
Preparing for the sports fest ought to be fun.

Kagura:
Thanks, Chiyo-chan.

Yomi:
Let's do this.

Chiyo:
Ready when you are!

Tomo:
Yeah, let's have some fun!

Kagura:
All right!

Tomo:
Yah... Boom!

Kagura:
What's wrong with you?!

Tomo:
All right!
There you go!

Yomi:
You go! You're in the way!

Kagura:
Man, I'm hungry.
I had to skip breakfast 'cause I woke up so late this morning.

Osaka:
That's too bad.

Kagura:
Ta-da!
Pork cutlet, rice and a big noodle bowl.

Yomi:
You'll gain weight.

Kagura:
Oh, I'm not too worried about that.
You see, I'm the type who never gains weight no matter how much I eat.
In fact, if I don't eat, I don't have any energy, so it's bad.

Yomi:
Oh yeah, is that so?!
Then why don't you go eat a hundred bowls of pork cutlet?!

Kagura:
What're you so mad about?

Osaka:
You're amazin'.
You know, I could never eat as much as you do.

Kagura:
Really?
So you think this is a lot?

Osaka:
Half of that...
Even a third of it would fill me up completely.

Yomi:
Oh, how very happy for you!

Osaka:
What'cha so mad for?

23-3. Hadn't Thought Of That
Kagura:
Right, guess we'll give it a go!

Chiyo:
Yeah!

Tomo:
The anticipation is making me shake!

Osaka:
The bread eatin' contest!

Kaorin:
Please do your best!
I'm not in your class, but I'll cheer for you!

Sakaki:
Um... Oh, thank you.

Yomi:
Okay, what's with bloomers?
Why do they still make us wear these?

Kimura:
Hurray!
Hurray!
Hurray!
Hurray!
Hurray!

I love those pants very very much.
<Latin?>Ego amo te<Latin>

Kagura:
Hey?!

Kimura
Ah!

Man:
Ready?!

Announce:
Next up is the costume race.

Kagura:
I think Tomo and Chiyo-chan are pairing up for the costume race, aren't they?
So what is Tomo gonna be?

Osaka:
The bread eatin' contest is comin' up.
Get it together.

Yomi:
A policewoman, I think?

Tomo:
Ding, ding, ding!
You're right!

Kagura:
Wow, you could practically join the ICPO right now!
So, where's Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Heya, lady.
It's nice to meetcha.

Tomo:
Here she is, the perp!

Kagura:
Huh?

Man:
Ready?!

Tomo:
Okay, let us through!
Make way!
Move it, move it!
Come on, make way! I said, move it!
You're in the way, damn it!
Hey, I said, make way!

Kagura:
Is pushing allowed?

Tomo:
Move it, move it, move it, move it!
Go, go, go,

Osaka:
Say...
I wonder what crime Chiyo-chan musta committed?

Tomo:
Make way! Let us through already!
Move it! Come on, I told you to make way!
All right! Number one!

Osaka:
Hey, they won.


Announce:
Next up is the bread eating contest.
Participants, please gather in front of the entrance gate.

Osaka:
Now, my turn.

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, please do your best!

Man:
Take your places!

Announce:
For this bread eating contest, going in order by lane, we've hung up sweet bean paste bread, cream bread, jam bread, curry bread, and melon bread.
Please go for whichever one you like.

Osaka:
Huh?
What the heck?!

Man:
Ready?!

Osaka:
Sweet bean paste, cream, curry, jam and melon, huh...?
Lemme think...

Shoot, I've only practiced with a sweet bean paste bread.
But if we're talkin' sweet, the jam or cream bread would be good, too.
Come to think of it, why's a cream bread have that lumpy shape?
I don't see any reason it couldn't be round.
Oh, I found one that doesn't belong.
Curry breads are fried.
Do they gotta fry it no matter what?
No, that's not it. So, sweet bean paste breads are round, cream breads are lumpy, and jam breads have pieces in 'em...
Oh, I don't know anymore.
I came in last.
I got the melon bread.
Ah...

23-4. We'll All Run Together
Yomi:
Right, right, left, left, front, down, jump!

Kaorin:
Oh, Yomi.

Yomi:
What's up?

Kaorin:
Yomi, the cheerleader, huh?

Yomi:
Something like that.

Kaorin:
Wow...
You just look so cute!

Yomi:
R-Really?

Kaorin:
Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Right, right, left, left, front, down, jump!

Kaorin:
You're so cute!

Tomo:
I found a spy!
So what could this someone from another class be up to?

Kaorin:
Oh, a boy's uniform?!

Tomo:
Yup! Me, Kagura, even Sakaki's wearing a boy's uniform!

Kaorin:
Ah!

Tomo:
Sakaki's wearing a boy's uniform!
Sakaki's wearing a boy's uniform!
Sakaki's wearing a boy's uniform!

Tomo:
Take that, and that, how's that?
Pretty cool, don't you think?

Kaorin:
Show me!
Ah...
Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah! Rah!

Osaka:
Last up is the relay!
Class versus class with everyone!

Tomo:
It's here, it's here, it's here!

Yomi:
Hey, don't get so worked up that you trip.

Kagura:
All right, now for the climax!

Sakaki:
Mm.

Chiyo:
I... I have to do my best. I just have to!
But what if I end up dragging everybody down again?

Sakaki:
Don't worry.

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Don't worry.

Yomi:
That's right.
After all, we've got Sakaki and Kagura in our class.
So it's okay.

Kagura:
You see, so you can just relax, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Right!

Tomo:
You've got me too!

Yomi:
Yeah for us.

Tomo:
What was that?!
Just watch!
We'll get first place!

Yomi:
Where do you get that confidence of yours?

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, I'm gonna teach ya a great tactic!

Chiyo:
A great tactic?

Osaka:
Ka-ching!
If you run with your hands out like this, it'll be hard for people to pass ya.

Chiyo:
You... you think so?

Osaka:
You're not passin' me!

Chiyo:
You... you really think so?

Announce:
At last, it's time for the class versus class 4000-meter relay.

Tomo:
Number one!
Number one runner!
Lots of expectations! Huge expectations!
Vital! Vital!
There's no way I'm not gonna lose this race to anyone!
Yomi, I'll hand you the baton as the number one runner!
Just you wait! Yeah! Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

Yomi:
She's gonna use up all her energy before it starts.

Man:
Ready?!

Yomi:
What?

Kagura:
What a start! Wow.

Tomo:
Move it, move it, move it, move it, move it, move it!!

Chiyo:
Amazing! Tomo's in the lead!

Kagura:
All right, Tomo! Go!

Yomi:
I better not start slacking either.

Tomo:
Uh...

Yomi:
I told you not to get too worked up before the start!
Arh!

Chiyo:
Are you okay?!

Tomo:
Yomi, run! It's a diet!

Yomi:
Shut up, moron!

Yukari:
Go! Leave them in the dust!
Come on! I'm telling you to pass them!
Oh, what are they doing?!
Come on, pass them there!
And there! And there! And there!
All right!

Girl:
Osaka!

Osaka:
Gotcha!
Ka-ching!

Chiyo:
Look out! They're passing you, they're passing you!

23-5. United
Yomi:
Oh, wow.

Tomo:
She's fast.

Osaka:
That's Kagura.

Yomi:
All right!

Tomo:
One more person!

Osaka:
You'll be in the lead!

Yukari:
Kagura! Hurry up and pass them, right now!

Kagura:
Chiyo-chan!
Damn!

Yomi:
Go for it, Chiyo-chan!

Tomo:
Don't you lose!

Osaka:
Come on!

Chiyo:
I have to do my best!
I've run every night, practicing just for this day!
I want to at least... at least get it to Miss Sakaki without being passed!

Girl:
I feel like I'm doing something bad.

Boy:
Ahaha, what're you doing, walking?!
Are you sure you wanna win?!
Huh, Class 3?!
There you go, hang in there!
Don't cry!

Chiyo:
Mi... Miss Sakaki...
I'm... I'm sorry!

Sakaki:
Don't worry!

Kagura:
You did great, Chiyo-chan!

Chiyo:
But I got passed by so many people!

Yomi:
Don't worry! Sakaki will win it back!
But... but.. but the other classes have boys and track and field people...

Tomo:
Hang on, Chiyo, take a look at that!

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki! Go! Go! Go! Go for it!
You can keep it up!

Amazing! She passed everyone out there!

Tomo:
Good job, Sakaki! First place!

Yukari:
Now, Sakaki, you just leave the rest to me!

Tomo:
Shoot! Our anchor is our homeroom teacher!
Go Yukari! Take it and run!

Nyamo:
Not so fast!
I'm coming for you!

Tomo:
Whoa, Nyamo's got speed!

Chiyo:
Go for it!
Miss Yukari, go for it!
Miss Yukari!

Everyone:
Oh...


Tomo:
Oh, man!
Yukari just had to go and ruin the whole thing.
And we didn't get any juice.

Yomi:
Honestly now, do you really like juice that much, Tomo?

Chiyo:
I think it was still a whole lot of fun though.

Everyone:
Huh?

Chiyo:
What?
Is something the matter?

Kagura:
But we did come in last place.

Tomo:
And we didn't get treated to juice either.

Yomi:
Yeah, enough about the juice already.

Chiyo:
But it really was a lot of fun!
Wasn't it, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
What? Oh, yeah, right.

Chiyo:
See, it really was a lot of fun!

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, you shouldn't be talkin' sour grapes.

Chiyo:
This isn't sour grapes!

Kagura:
Oh, no, it's sour grapes, all right.

Yomi:
After all, Chiyo-chan really hates to lose.

Chiyo:
That's not it!
Please tell them, Miss Sakaki!

Sakaki:
Oh, yeah.

Tomo:
All right, we'll just say that we had fun and leave it at that!

Chiyo:
I'm not lying!
It really and truly was a lot of fun!


-- Preview --

Chiyo:
Meow, meow, meow, meow, meow!
Miss Sakaki, you like cats, don't you?

Sakaki:
Yeah.

Chiyo:
But you can't keep cats at home, can you?

Sakaki:
If I live alone, maybe...

Osaka:
Hey, Sakaki, you're goin' to get a cat?
One like pikanyaa?

Chiyo:
That's yamapikaryaa.
We met one on Iriomote Island.

Sakaki:
Ma-Mayaa!

Osaka:
You can see the continuation next time.

24-1. Career Paths
Yomi:
Hey, Tomo!
You're not in grade school anymore, so knock it off!

Tomo:
Hah, hah, but you can't catch me!


Sakaki:
Ah!

Osaka:
Oh! What'cha doin', Sakaki?
Say, looks like you're on the internet.
Ah!
Which means you're on the internet. Forget I asked ya.

Chiyo:
Then, why did you ask?

Osaka:
Hm?

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka...

Osaka:
Oh, there's a dead pikanyaa.

Chiyo:
No, that's yamapikaryaa, or yamamayaa.
Did a car...?
Because I heard traffic accidents were one of the biggest threats to yamamayaa.

Osaka:
Poor, poor pikanyaa.

Chiyo:
What's the matter?

Sakaki:
This cat...
I have a feeling it's that mother cat.

Chiyo, Osaka:
Oh!

Chiyo:
When did the accident happen?

Sakaki:
The day after our school trip.

Chiyo:
But I can't tell whether or not it's her, though.

Osaka:
Poor thing.
It'd be good if it wasn't her...
But it's still not good.

Chiyo:
It's so sad...

Sakaki:
I wonder if he's okay?


Chiyo:
Mr. Tadakichi was half asleep this morning.

Sakaki:
Really?
Oh, look. The name plate's gone.

Chiyo:
Uh-huh, the people who lived here moved away.

Sakaki:
I didn't know.
Remember there used to be a big cat living here.

Chiyo:
That's right. Maru.
He was a big and peculiar cat, wasn't he?

Sakaki:
Yeah, he was the boss around here.

Chiyo:
Well, they'll have a changing of the guard!

Sakaki:
Hm.

Chiyo:
There are a lot of cats in this area.
It must be tough to be the boss.

Sakaki:
Yeah.


Chiyo:
Timetable time, timetable time. Get it ready early and you'll never have to worry.
Oh...
Please promise you be careful around cars and things, okay?
What? Is something the matter?
Aw!
Yeah, you're right. Sorry about that, Mr. Tadakichi.
I'm the one who needs to be more careful, huh.

A work sheet. I almost forgot.

Sakaki:
I wanna go here.
Although it would be pretty hard to commute to, I guess I'd be living on my own.

No, wait!
If that's the case, then having a pet...
Mm!
Yeah.
Mm-hm.

24-2. Showdown
Kagura:
I see, so you wanna be an animal doctor, huh, Sakaki?

Sakaki:
Yeah, but there aren't that many veterinary universities.
How about you?

Kagura:
I'm planning to apply somewhere with strong sports program.
I wanna keep up my swimming after highschool.

Sakaki:
So do you wanna be a P.E. teacher?

Kagura:
Haven't really thought much about it, but that's one way to go.

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki!
I brought that cat catalog you wanted.

Sakaki:
Uh...

Chiyo:
Here.

Kagura:
Huh?

Sakaki:
Thanks, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Sure.

Kagura:
What's this? Are you getting a cat?

Sakaki:
No, my parents can't handle them. I'm just looking.

Kagura:
Ooh, so are they cat haters?

Sakaki:
No, it's my mother. She's allergic to cats, so we can't get one.

Kagura:
Allergies, huh? I guess it can't be helped then.
Well, no big deal!
No cat you got would ever like you!

Chiyo:
Ah!

Kagura:
Think positive! Positive!
Right?!

Sakaki:
Positive?

Chiyo:
I'm sure that's not true, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
When I graduate and go to college, I'm gonna live by myself and get my very own cat.

Chiyo, Kagura:
Wow...

Kagura:
But, Sakaki, cats really just hate you.

Chiyo:
Argh!

Kagura:
How could you keep one?

Sakaki:
That's the problem.

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, think positive! Think positive!

Osaka:
Speakin' of career path, you're goin' to America, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Uh-huh.

Osaka:
Then, what's gonna happen to Mr. Tadakichi?

Chiyo:
Well, right now, it looks like I'm gonna end up living at a friend's place over there.
And they said Mr. Tadakichi is welcome to stay.

Osaka:
Really? Well, that's good.

The French Mr. Tadakichi, and the Japanese Chiyo-chan, goin' to America...
It's hard to say who's the foreigner there.

Chiyo:
Oh...
Miss Osaka sure is interesting.

Osaka:
See you tomorrow!

Chiyo:
Bye-bye now!

Sakaki:
Bye.

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, you're going to a veterinary university, right?

Sakaki:
Yeah.

Chiyo:
You know, it'll be nice if you get to live with a cat too.

Sakaki:
Yeah... Oh.

Chiyo:
O-Oh...

Sakaki:
It's a cat.

Chiyo:
Wow, it's like there're just so many of them!

Sakaki:
Uh...

Chiyo:
Yeah...

Sakaki:
Um...

Chiyo:
They're all... so angry, something's wrong!

Sakaki:
Uh!
Kamineko!
I don't really know why, but that cat is always hostile towards me.

Chiyo:
What?!

Ah! Cat claws have lots of germs.
Grandma's hand got scratched, and it swelled out!

Sakaki:
Chiyo, get back.

Yamamayaa?!

Chiyo:
Huh?

Incredible! He chased them away!

Sakaki:
Yamamayaa, how did... What are you doing here?
Ah, are you okay?!

Chiyo:
He may be weakened or even sick!
The vet that Mr. Tadakichi goes to is nearby! Let's go there!

Sakaki:
Right!

24-3. Let's Go Quickly
Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, in here.
Doctor!
Doctor! Dr. Ishihara!

Woman:
Oh, Miss Chiyo Mihama.

Chiyo:
Oh, please ma'am, this is an emergency!
We've got to see him right away!

Woman:
The doctor went for a snack...

Doctor:
What's all the ruckus out here?

Chiyo:
Doctor!

Doctor:
Ah, Chiyo-chan, you sure have grown.
You'll break two meters one day.

Chiyo:
Yes, thanks for the compliments.
But there's a patient who needs your help.

Doctor:
Oh? Hm...

Chiyo:
Let's wait here.
It'll be fine now that Dr. Ishihara is on it, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Mm.

Chiyo:
It's thanks to Dr. Ishihara that Mr. Tadakichi is always so healthy.
Let's have a seat.

Sakaki:
Mm.

Chiyo:
Is that cat really...

Sakaki:
It is him.
I'm certain it's the yamamayaa that we met out there on our school trip.

Chiyo:
That's what I thought.
Although I'm surprised he was able to find you, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Mm.
That's it. The yamamayaa came to see me.

Doctor:
Oh, Chiyo-chan, you've grown since I last saw you.

Chiyo:
Yes, sir, thank you very much.

Sakaki:
How is he?

Chiyo:
He'll be okay, right?!

Doctor:
Well... he's physically weakened, but he'll be perfectly fine.
Your friend will recover as long as he eats well and gets plenty of rest.

Chiyo,Sakaki:
Uh.

Doctor:
By the way, that's a strange cat you've got.

Chiyo,Sakaki:
Uh...

Doctor:
I've been a vet for quite some time, but never seen anyone like him.
He's almost like a... an iriomote...

Sakaki:
He's a mixed breed.

Doctor:
Hm?

Sakaki:
Yeah, a mixed breed.

Doctor:
I see.
Mixed, eh?

Sakaki:
Mixed breed. A Mix. He's a mixed breed.

Doctor:
Is that right, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Oh, yes! He's a mixed breed.

Doctor:
I see. Well, go on and take him home.
Take good care of him.

Chiyo, Sakaki:
Yes.

Chiyo:
Thanks, Dr. Ishihara!

Sakaki:
Thank you very much, Doctor.

Chiyo:
Isn't it great that he's okay?

Sakaki:
Yeah.

Chiyo:
So then what now?
What will you do with him?

Sakaki:
I'm not sure I really know what the right thing to do is.
But you know...
I think he risked his life to come here because he believed in me.
I think it... must have been really hard.
I feel like I have to do everything I can, not to let him down.

Chiyo:
Absolutely.
But at your place, with your mother...

Sakaki:
Yeah.

Chiyo:
I know! Hey, why don't I house him until springtime?

Sakaki:
What?

Chiyo:
That way, when you find a place to live on your own, you can come and take him.

Sakaki:
Are you sure?

Chiyo:
Yes!

Sakaki:
Is that okay, yamamayaa?

Yamamayaa:
Meow.

Chiyo:
Oh, he answered!

Sakaki:
I know! Mayaa.
His name's gonna be Mayaa.

Chiyo:
I wonder if Mayaa will get along with Mr. Tadakichi?

Sakaki:
I know I can.


Tomo:
Wow! The yamamayaa came here?! Wow!

Chiyo:
We've been keeping him in my house for now, right?

Sakaki:
Mm-hm.

Tomo:
Sweet! Awesome! Yamamayaa!
Awesome! Awesome! Yamamayaa!
Yay! Wow!

Yomi:
It's awesome, but you're going overboard.

Osaka:
Then, why don't we go and pay him a visit.
'Cause you know, it's been a long time.

Tomo:
Yay! It's Chiyo-chan's, we go!

Osaka:
Yeah!

Tomo:
You come too, won't ya?

Yomi:
Yeah, yeah.

Kagura:
Yeah, no practice today.

Chiyo:
So, then it's the six of us.

Huh? Huh?
Where's Miss Sakaki?

Osaka:
Maybe, the bathroom.

Chiyo:
Outside?! Already?!

Tomo:
Wow!

24-4. Popularity
Tomo:
I guess this is what they call "trooping along", huh.

Kagura:
Is it hard to take care of him and stuff?

Sakaki:
Mm-hm. I've read some books for research.

Kagura:
Wow.

I see... Hmm...
The ecology of Nishihyou Island is...

Tomo:
That's "Iriomote"!

Kagura:
I did that on purpose!
I know that!
It slipped out!

Tomo:
Which is it?

Osaka:
The pikanyaa came a long way.

Chiyo:
I keep telling you it's not pikanyaa.

Osaka:
Really?
Pika...
Pika...
Pi?
Pika...
Pika...
Pi...

Chiyo:
Shall we just say that pikanyaa is okay too?

Yomi:
No, that'll just spoil her.

Tomo:
Oh!
Chiyo-chan, will Mr. Tadakichi be okay?!
He just might get eaten up!

Chiyo:
Oh, he'll be fine. He's way too big to get eaten.

Kagura:
Iriomote cats are sometimes even known to hunt and eat full-grown wild boars.

Chiyo:
Ahhhh!
We've got to hurry home!
Hurry, you guys!

Osaka:
Wait! I'm sure he's gonna be fine!

Tomo:
Maybe it's too late already!

Kagura:
All right! The race is on!

Chiyo:
Don't leave me!
Come on, you guys, wait for me!
Wait...

Tomo:
Is Chiyo-chan coming yet?
Hm?

Ah... Oh, no! We didn't make it!

Chiyo:
Mr. Tadakichi!

Sakaki:
Mayaa!

Tadakichi:
...

Sakaki:
Mayaa.

Chiyo:
Thank goodness you're... Ah!
Mr. Tada...

Narration:
Azumanga Daioh!

Chiyo:
Please, come on in.

Osaka:
Wow, how nice.
It's a big heated table.
Can I sit at the heated table?

Kagura:
I used your bathroom.

Chiyo:
Please, go ahead.

Tomo:
Hey, she's already there.

Osaka:
It's nice. This heated table is nice.
Oh, hello there, pi... ka...
Pika... nyaa?

Chiyo:
Sure, you can call him pikanyaa.

Tadakichi:
...

Tomo:
Tadakichi, I'm gonna eat you!
Come on, come on, what are you gonna do? Meow.

Yomi:
You might wanna stop that.
Mayaa's gonna get mad at you.

Tomo:
Huh?
Ha-ha-ha-ha...

Osaka:
It's really very comfortable, this heated table sure is nice.

Tomo:
I am a great iriomote cat!
Roar! Roar, roar, roar!

Yomi:
Give it a rest, huh!

Tomo:
Ah!

Yomi:
Hm?

Tomo:
It hurts!

Yomi:
Wah!

Tomo:
It hurts! It hurts me!

Chiyo:
Blood! There's so much blood! Blood!

Yomi:
See?! what did I tell you?!

Kagura:
Call an ambulance now!

Sakaki:
Hey, you can't scratch people.

Yomi:
No! It's okay!
Good work!

Kagura:
This is for getting carried away!

Yomi:
Well, see you tomorrow at school.

Osaka:
Till we heat again.

Yomi:
Sakaki?

Sakaki:
I'm going to stay for a little bit.

Chiyo:
Tomo, are you okay?

Tomo:
I hate that cat.

Yomi:
It's your own fault.
For once you suffer the consequence.

Kagura:
Yeah, she is right!

Osaka:
Well, see ya.

Chiyo:
Oh, yes, good-bye.

Tomo:
It hurts.

Yomi:
It's a good lesson. Learn something from it.

Kagura:
Yeah, really.

Yomi:
Moron.

Kagura:
Moron.

Chiyo:
That's some scolding just for getting hurt.

Osaka:
Till we heat again.


24-5. Together With Mayaa
Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, why don't you stay over tonight?

Sakaki:
Is that okay?

Chiyo:
Yes, it's okay.
Mayya will sleep better if you are here with him.

Sakaki:
Sure.

Chiyo:
Then, Miss Sakaki, please go ahead on back to the room, okay?
I'll make coffee or something.
Cooking is so fun, cooking is so fun.
Now it's time to take a break and see what we have done.

Sakaki:
Soon we'll be together everyday, won't we?
Mayaa?
Mayaa.
Mayaa, you're so cute!

Chiyo:
Okay, thanks for waiting.
Um, coffee is ready...

Sakaki:
Thank you.

Chiyo:
Uh...

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan's heated table was nice.

Tomo:
Damn it, my hand hurts so much.

Yomi:
And whose fault is that?

Tomo:
Like hell I'll ever trust an animal again!

Kagura:
You started it.
Mayaa didn't like what you were doing to him.

Yomi:
Look, if you had been nice to him, he wouldn't have scratched you.

Osaka:
Hey, look. It's a cat.

Tomo, Yomi, Kagura:
Huh?

Osaka:
Kitty-nyaa.

Yomi:
Good, an example! Tomo, come on!

Tomo:
Huh?

Yomi:
Here, come on.
See? Nothing to be afraid of.

Kamineko:
Garrrr.

Yomi:
Huh?
Nothing to fear.

Kamineko:
Garrrr.

Tomo:
What the?!

Yomi:
That's odd.

Osaka:
Kitty-nyaa ran away.

Tomo:
Why the heck were you using my hand?

Yomi:
I didn't wanna get bitten.

Tomo:
Uh...

Kagura:
It's good to have a fear put into you once in a while.

Chiyo:
Get Mayaa clean, get Mayaa clean,

Sakaki:
That's a good boy.
Almost done.

Chiyo:
He's certainly very well-behaved around you.

Sakaki:
Huh?

Chiyo:
You know, I tried to wash him yesterday, but he really fought up a storm.

Sakaki:
Is that right?
Here comes rinse.
Okay, you're all clean now.

Chiyo:
Are you ready, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
Mm-hm.

Chiyo:
Okay, lights out.

Sakaki:
Mayaa.

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki, I guess you really love animals, don't you?

Sakaki:
I like cute things.
Because I've always been big, even when I was younger, and I was never cute.

Chiyo:
That's not true at all.

Sakaki:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Earlier when I saw you playing with Mayaa, you were actually very cute.

Sakaki:
Uh.
You... think?

Chiyo:
Yes, you were both very cute, tee-hee.

Sakaki:
Uh?

Chiyo:
You know, I think Mayaa thinks of you as his mother.

Sakaki:
Good night, Mayaa.


-- Preview --

Everyone:
Oh, God! Please show us your love!

Kagura:
It's the entrance exams!
There are here!

Tomo:
Don't worry.
I was real generous with my offering on our first shrine visit of the year!

Osaka:
Wow, Tomo, how much did you give?

Tomo:
Five yen!

Everyone:
Oh, God! Please show us your love!

Osaka:
Speakin' of which, are we gonna get to graduate?

Kagura:
I-I hadn't thought about that.

25-1. Career Path Discussion
Tomo:
You are all working so hard at it.

Yomi:
You talk as if you were not even a part of it.
You've got exams too, don't you?

Tomo:
Ahahaha! No need to worry!
The truth is I came up with an absolutely splendid idea!

Chiyo:
Idea?

Tomo:
Uh-huh, since you're going abroad, you're not taking entrance exams, right?

Chiyo:
Uh, yeah...

Tomo:
So, if I go study abroad, I won't have to take entrance exams either!
I'm the smartest person ever!

Yomi:
Then, you do that.

Tomo:
Oh, vocab.
Huh, here, let me quiz you, guys.

Yomi:
This is sudden.

Tomo:
Um... the summer fruit you eat before you go swimming?

Yomi:
Huh? What the heck is this?

Chiyo:
Oh, that would have to be watermelon.

Tomo:
Noooo!
The answer's persimmon!
It's for swimming!

Chiyo:
Ah... Oh!

Tomo:
I don't know if it's good that you're so impressed...
Okay, tell me who's always banging up cars?

Chiyo:
Ah, Miss Yukari?

Tomo:
Yeah, I know where you're coming from, but no.

Chiyo:
Someone who works in a scrap-yard?

Tomo:
Noooo!
No, it's the dentist!

Chiyo:
Uh... Ah!

Osaka:
Oh, hey, whatcha doin'?

Tomo:
I was quizzing Chiyo-chan about some stuff.

Osaka:
Really? Like what?

Tomo:
What kind of bird doesn't get along with police?!

Osaka:
A rook?

Tomo:
Oh! So quickly!

Chiyo:
That was amazing!

Osaka:
It is?

Tomo:
Okay, who built Osaka Castle?

Osaka:
The mason.

Tomo:
"Nihongo" is Japanese.
What then is "Eigo"?

Osaka:
Still Japanese.

Tomo:
A truck with pumpkins, eggplants and tomatoes hit a sharp turn, what fell off?

Osaka:
Would it be speed?

Tomo:
A-Amazing! What is with her?!

Osaka:
What? Was I right?
Oh, Chiyo-chan, there's somethin' I wanna discuss.

Chiyo:
Yes? What is it?

Osaka:
Tell me, can you think what kind of job I might be suited for?

Chiyo:
Huh? Hmm, let me think...
Oh, have you thought about becoming a school teacher?

Osaka:
Ooh...

Chiyo:
I bet you would raise students who were flexible thinkers!

Osaka:
Ah!

Yomi:
I don't know.

Osaka:
Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
Oh, Osaka.
You're the only one who hasn't turned in your school choice.
Hurry up and make up your mind, all right?

Osaka:
Yeah, well, about that...
See, I'm gonna become a school teacher.

Yukari:
What?! Are you out of your mind?!

Osaka:
Not really.
Chiyo-chan said I'd be well suited for it.

Yukari:
What did you say?!

Osaka:
Huh?

Yukari:
Look here, Miss Chiyo!
You think I'm an idiot, don't you?

Yukari:
You probably think being a teacher is a job even stupid people can do!
I'm right, aren't I?!
If being a prodigy is going to your head, I'll be happy to knock that right out!


Osaka:
Hello!

Tomo:
Help us study!

Chiyo:
Miss Sakaki is here too.

Tomo:
Oh, I didn't know that.

Tomo:
All right, let's get cracking!

Osaka:
But this table's dangerous.
It's like I'm falling asleep.

Chiyo:
Yeah, you're right.

Osaka:
Hah!

Chiyo:
Hm? Uh...

Like you're falling asleep?

Yomi:
Hey there!

Kagura:
Help us study!

Yomi:
Oh? So are Tomo and the others here?

Chiyo:
They are.
They're all studying with Miss Sakaki.

Yomi:
Studying, huh?

Chiyo:
Y-Yes...

25-2. Prayers For Acceptance
Tomo:
The New Year!

Everybody:
Happy New Year!
May your new year be blessed.

Yomi:
A long-sleeved kimono, huh?

Osaka:
It looks real good on ya.

Chiyo:
Oh, my. There're so many people.

Osaka:
Not good. At this rate, all of us are gonna get separated.

Tomo:
Well, then let's pick our rally points.
Everyone, if you get lost, meet up at Sakaki!

Yomi:
Okay, got it!

Kagura:
Yep, that's a roger!

Sakaki:
Hmm...

Chiyo:
You seem rather sleepy today.

Yomi:
Yep, I was up so late studying I heard the watch night bell sound.

Chiyo:
Oh, that's right, isn't it?
I forgot that the center exam is coming up.
Okay, then, I understand!
Since I'm not taking exams, I will pray for all of you as well!

Tomo:
Oh! Imbue my being with your prodigy power so that I too may pass.

Yomi:
Your being?

Osaka:
Oh, I better get the money offerin' ready soon.

Yomi:
Okay, I'm gonna be generous.

Osaka:
That's a 500 yen coin!
Oh, I can't let that beat me out!

Yomi:
No way!
You're doing paper bills?!

Osaka:
This is it!

Yomi:
A ten yen coin, Osaka?
That's pretty lame. You'll fail at this rate.

Osaka:
No, you're wrong!
This coin is the chosen one among ten yen coins!

Yomi:
It's what?

Tomo:
Now that you mentioned it, I can almost see it!

Chiyo:
Why is this coin the chosen one?

Osaka:
This ten yen coin here always came back no matter which machine I put it in.

Yomi:
You sure that's a good thing?

Chiyo:
Finally, our turn is coming up, huh?

Osaka:
Gonna pray good and proper.

Chiyo:
May everyone pass their tests together.
Miss Osaka...

Kagura:
Hey, let's draw sacred lots!

Tomo:
Yes, I accept your challenge!

Kagura:
Number 8!

Tomo:
Number 15!

Kagura:
Small blessing!

Tomo:
Strife!
What?!

Kagura:
You mean...

Yomi:
Bad luck?

Chiyo:
You... you got bad luck?

Tomo:
Yeah, bad luck.

Yomi:
Wow, you're right, Tomo.
They have those, huh? That's incredible.

Osaka:
It's just too good to be true.

Tomo:
Bad luck. Wh-What should I do?
J-Just what am I supposed to do with this?
Tie it to a tree?

Chiyo:
I believe there was someone that I heard if you tie a sacred lot, then it'll become cleansed and bad things will be banished.

Tomo:
Then, I gotta tie it!

Chiyo:
But I also heard people say if you tie it, the stuff written on it will come true.

Tomo:
What?! Am I just doomed?!
What should I do?! What should I do?!
Please tell me you're gonna help me here?

Yomi:
Yeah, you're probably just doomed, Tomo.

Tomo:
Ah! No way!

Kagura:
All right, how about we get something to eat on the way home?

Yomi:
You know there's a really good sweets shop up ahead.

Osaka:
Ain't ya on a diet, Yomi?

Yomi:
Actually, a moderate amount of sugar is needed to stimulate the brain.

Kagura:
We got teachers ahead.

Nyamo:
Huh?

Yukari:
Oh, shoot!

Tomo:
Yukari, New Year's allowance!
Give us a New Year's money!

Kagura:
Gimme, gimme!

Osaka:
Please, Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
What was that? I can't hear what you're saying!

Tomo:
Cheapskate!

Kagura:
Cheapskate!

Osaka:
Cheapskate!

Yukari:
What did you call me?!

Tomo:
Run away!

Chiyo:
Miss Kurosawa, Happy New Year.
May your year be blessed.

Nyamo:
Happy New Year.
Have you made your first shrine visit yet?

Yomi:
We did. At the shrine back there.

Yukari:
Hey, hold on, you guys didn't know?

Tomo:
Huh? We didn't know what?

Yukari:
Know that the son of that shrine went and failed to get into college.
They won't help you.

Everyone:
What?!

25-3. Fight
Tomo:
All right, it's time for the center exam!
Let's take this chance to do it together and get terrible scores!

Kagura, Yomi:
Uh...

Tomo:
We're done for.

Osaka, Kagura:
Yeah...

Chiyo:
Uh, you guys...

Osaka:
Do not worry.
I'll be teaching ya a good charm.

Tomo:
A charm, huh?

Yomi:
They're just chopsticks?

Osaka:
Did I give one to everybody?
Then, please listen to me.
If you can split these neatly, then the test will go well.

Everyone:
Wh-What?!

Kagura:
Wow, I had no idea. Never heard of this charm before.

Osaka:
I developed it.

Kagura,Tomo:
Ah!

Osaka:
Do not worry. It will work.

Kagura:
You can't just make charms up!

Osaka:
Y'all are just too skeptical.
Look here, I'm gonna show you how to do it.

Everyone:
Uh...

Osaka:
See now, that didn't count.

Yomi:
Huh, no good.

Chiyo:
Hey, um, I've been meaning to mention this for a while.
With disposable chopsticks, if you hold the ends and split them slowly...
See? Nice and neat.

Osaka:
No way?! I-I didn't know there was a trick to it!

Ah... It's... it's so beautiful... A perfect break...
If I use this, college will be just...

Hey, everyone, lemme show you one more time.
Just like this and...
Tomo, what'd you do?

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
You didn't make a proper split!

Tomo:
What? Oh...

Osaka:
Hah, you weren't holding the ends, were ya?

Tomo:
Nuh-uh?

Osaka:
We said it. You gotta hold 'em by the ends!
It's no good! Listen to what people tell ya!
Argh!

Tomo:
I... I'm sorry then.
Hey, why am I being scolded?

Osaka:
There's no hope. There's no more hope for ya, Tomo.

Tomo:
What?! No way!

Chiyo:
Oh, so um...
Anyway, I brought some good luck charms to hand out to everyone.

Tomo:
What?

Yomi:
More charms, again?

Chiyo:
I thought about buying them on our shrine visit but I ended up making them myself.

Kagura:
So, these are for us?

Chiyo:
Correct. I have one charm for each of you.

Yomi:
Wow.

Chiyo:
Here, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Thanks, Chiyo-chan.

Tomo:
Wow...

Kagura:
Here we go. Now this looks like it'll work!

Yomi:
It's almost time for it.

Tomo:
Yeah.

Kagura:
We've done all we can.
Let's get in there and do our best!

Osaka:
I agree.

Sakaki:
Mm.

Chiyo:
All right, you guys, I'll be praying that all goes well for everybody.

Yomi:
Well, then, shall we go?!

Tomo:
Let's go!

Chiyo:
Um...

Everyone:
Huh?

Chiyo:
Best of luck!

Everybody:
Ha-ha.

Chiyo:
Oh, wow, you look like you're tired. So, how did it go? Oh...

Tomo:
Who cares! It doesn't matter!

Chiyo:
Ah? Was it really that bad?

Tomo:
There were a lot of stupid questions where I could only narrow the answer down to two...

Chiyo:
These questions are kind of boring.
Miss Yukari's tests are more interesting than this.
Your intelligence cannot be measured by these problems.
Please don't let it discourage you!

Tomo:
Okay.

Osaka:
Hey, Chiyo-chan,
Some of the stuff you taught me came up on the test.

Chiyo:
Oh, how lucky for you.

Osaka:
Uh-huh, I was lucky.

Tomo:
Osaka, did you get some tutoring from Chiyo-chan?

Osaka:
A little on non-school days recently.

Tomo:
Oh, yeah, so you were perfectly ready, huh?

Osaka:
Well, it was kinda like what Chiyo-chan just told ya.

Tomo:
Huh?

Osaka:
My intelligence simply cannot solve these kinds of problems.

Chiyo, Tomo:
Uh...


25-4. Study Group
Chiyo-papa:
Hello there, everymeow.
<Spanish> Como estas? Bien gracious.<Spanish>

Osaka:
Oh, my god!

Chiyo-papa:
There are some times when I wish I were a bird.

Osaka:
Wait, whatcha saying things like that for?

Chiyo-papa:
My daughter is flying to America.

Osaka:
But if you were a bird?

Chiyo-papa:
I am not a bird. Can you not see that I am a cat!
If I were not, what would you say I am?

Osaka:
Hold on, I know, you look like that American guy.
You know, like Bill Clinton.

Chiyo-papa:
Oh...

Osaka:
Oh, no, I'm so sorry!

Chiyo-papa:
Hm? Are you the real cat? The true cat?
I have a cat's tongue and hate hot food.
But what of you? O cat?

Osaka:
Oh, I've got a cat's tongue too!

Chiyo-papa:
Then I shall yank that tongue right out of your head there!

Osaka:
What?! Why?!
Uh...

Yomi:
Good morning.

Osaka:
I wasn't sleepin'. I was studyin' honestly.
Huh? Hang on, this looks just like Chiyo-chan's place.

Yomi:
Good morning.

Sakaki:
Uh.

Chiyo:
Okay, time to take a snack break!
Today, we have millefeuille.

Kagura:
Ooh.

Tomo:
Yes, finally!

Yomi:
Sugar is necessary to keep your mind working, isn't it?

Osaka:
Uh-huh.

Yomi:
So, it should be okay if I eat them, right?

Osaka:
It's okay.

Chiyo:
Hello, Miss Sakaki, what are you doing over there?

Sakaki:
I'm kinda stuck here in this spot.

Chiyo:
Here, Miss Sakaki.

Sakaki:
Huh?

Chiyo:
I brought you a snack.

Sakaki:
Oh, thanks very much.
Ah...

Chiyo:
No, no, there's none for you.

Sakaki:
Oh. Is he not allowed to have cake then?

Chiyo:
Uh-uh, we try our best not to feed him sweets or anything like that.

Osaka:
Oh, that was delicious. Thanks, Chiyo-chan.

Yomi:
See, you really do need sugar to keep your mind working.

Osaka:
Yeah, I see.

Yomi:
Yeah, I was right, I was so right.

Kagura:
Okay, doing my best on the homestretch!

Tomo:
But you're not gonna beat me!

Chiyo:
Hm...

Tomo:
Huh?
What's wrong, Chiyo-chan?

Chiyo:
Oh, I was just thinking that we'll graduate soon.

Kagura:
Yeah, that's right.
I completely forgot because of the exams coming up.

Sakaki:
Hm.

Tomo:
Well, assuming nothing happens when we do get to graduate.

Yomi:
You say that so cheerfully.

Chiyo:
Although, it's already been three years since we all first met.

Kagura:
I've only been around since the second year, but man, a lot has happened.

Osaka:
Yeah for real. Three years go by in no time at all.
Chiyo-chan's grown quite a bit!
You have.

Chiyo:
Do you think so?

Osaka:
Sakaki's breasts've grown too!

Sakaki:
Uh...

Osaka:
I've gotten it together much better.
And Tomo...

Yomi:
Hey, hey...
Don't think I'm gonna buy into that!

Chiyo:
Everyone's individual entrance exams have finally begun.
All I can do now is pray for my friends.
Please do your best!


25-5. Tomo and Osaka, the Fateful Day
Nyamo:
Hey, I hear Kagura is getting her results back today, isn't she.

Yukari:
Is she, really?

Nyamo:
That's your answer?
She's your student, you really should remember these things, you know.

Yukari:
Yes, ma'am, you're so right.

Kagura:
Miss Yukari, I made it! I made it in!

Yukari:
What?!

Nyamo:
I'm proud of you!

Yukari:
Yeah, well, I had faith that you'd get accepted, Kagura.

Kagura:
But you just screamed "What?!", when I told you.

Tomo:
Incredible! So Kagura made it in?!

Chiyo:
Congratulations! I'm really glad for you!

Kagura:
Thanks, Chiyo-chan.
It's all because of the good luck charm you gave me.

Chiyo:
Oh, no! It was your own abilities, Miss Kagura!

Tomo:
So bright!

Kagura:
Huh?

Tomo:
You are shining so brightly now!

Kagura:
So did they not accept you?

Tomo:
Uh... it was thin.
The envelope I got was thin and the piece of paper inside it said "No."

Chiyo:
Don't you worry! We still have the announcement board left, remember?
Your number will be there!

Tomo:
Really? You stake your life on it?

Chiyo:
I sure will!

Kagura:
What?

Osaka:
Hey, everyone!

Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Osaka.

Osaka:
Okay, well, the results from my first school came back.
But I haven't looked at it yet.
Chiyo-chan, you've really been there for me through the exams.
So I wanted you here for this too.

Chiyo:
Oh, I see.

Osaka:
So, what's it gonna be?

Tomo:
Oh, it's thin!

Osaka, Chiyo:
Ah!

Kagura:
Don't be discouraged!
You still got others, right?!

Osaka:
But this school, this was supposed to be my safety net.

Kagura:
Oh.

Chiyo:
Don't you worry! It'll be just fine!

Osaka:
For real?

Chiyo:
I'll stake my life!

Kagura:
Don't be in such a hurry to die.

Osaka:
Say, Sakaki, did you get your results?

Sakaki:
Oh, yeah, I got into the first one.
But I haven't heard from my main choice.

Osaka:
Wow, that's really something.
It's a university for vets, right?

Sakaki:
That's right.

Osaka:
Say, veterinarians, do they...

Sakaki:
Huh?

Osaka:
Do they take care of beetles as well?

Sakaki:
What? Well, Um...

Tomo:
All right, the time has finally arrived!
The crucial moments!

Osaka:
Crucial.

Chiyo:
Mm!

Tomo:
So, will it be life or death?!

Osaka:
Death?

Tomo:
Okay! Before I go look at the announcement board, recharge this with your uncanny exams passing prayer power!

Chiyo:
Yes, right away!

Chiyo:
Uuuuum, Yah!
All right! You should be just fine now!

Tomo:
O... Okay.

Osaka:
Oh, oh, do mine too!

Tomo:
Okay, let's have a look!

Osaka:
I'm ready.

Chiyo:
But Miss Yomi tried for two places and both fell through.

Tomo:
Oh, the book just fell... oops...

Osaka:
Oh, hey, guess what? The graduation trip...

Tomo:
Shh! Stop it! We can't talk about it yet!

Osaka:
Uh...

Tomo:
Osaka, We're fine, but...

Yomi:
Yeah, but what?! You have something you wanna say?!

Tomo:
Hey, don't worry! You'll get into the next one.

Yomi:
I don't need your sympathy.
I've still got my main choice left!
And don't worry. I'm gonna be accepted there.
Then I'm gonna have lots of fun!
With everyone!

Chiyo:
That's right. We'll all go together!

Tomo:
Definitely. It'll be great if we're all together.

Yomi:
Somehow, it just doesn't sound right when you say it!
So, what if I'm the only one who hasn't gotten in.
Ha-ha-ha.

Tomo:
Yomi's, Yomi's a goner!

Chiyo:
Please hang in there!


-- Preview --

Yukari:
Okay, it's the end, the end!
Good riddance.

Tomo:
What?
What do you mean, the end?!
Are you saying it's the final episode?!

Yukari:
Yeah, you guys are graduating, remember?

Tomo:
So once we graduate, that's gonna be it for the show?!

Osaka:
We're gonna die after that?

Yukari:
Don't worry.
All of you will continue to live on forever in everyone's hearts.

Everyone:
Miss Yukari!

26-1. First Graduation Ever
Chiyo:
Let's see...
Oh, Um... There's nothing I need to bring today.

I'm heading out!
Mr. Tadakichi, good morning.
Hey, you know what?
Today is the graduation ceremony.
This will be the first time I've ever graduated.
Okay, I'll see you later.

Sakaki:
Oh.
I'm sorry for always trying to pet you against your will.

Kamineko:
Meow!

Sakaki:
Huh?
Well, okay... May I pet you then?
Ow...

Chiyo:
Good morning, everybody!

Tomo:
Whoa!
"Female College Graduate Employment Rate At An All Time Low!" it says.
You know, at this rate, it might be useless even if you do get in.

Yomi:
I am getting in!

Tomo:
Okay, I admit I heard this from the cafeteria lady, but she said if you go to college, your marrying age gets pushed back!
Great news, how's Yomi?

Yomi:
I said, I'm getting in, damn it!

Osaka:
Mornin', Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka, good morni...
What do you have there? Some tissues?

Osaka:
Ah-ah, they aren't ordinary tissues.
These ones are high class for real.

Chiyo:
I see. So, why do you have them?

Osaka:
I'll reveal the secret.
And there ya have it.

Chiyo:
Ah! Oh, you have hay fever?

Osaka:
That's right, hay fever.
But I'm covered.
I've got eye drops too.
Although I'm one of those people who can't apply 'em unless I lie down.

Kagura:
So, what are you doing?

Chiyo:
Miss Osaka is using eye drops...

Kagura:
Eye drops, huh?

Osaka:
That's right, I've got hay fever.
Achoo...

Kagura:
Huh? Was that a sneeze?
Ha-ha-ha. That was really great!

Osaka:
What're you sayin'? There's nothin' great about it.
Achoo...

Tomo:
Hay fever looks like fun.

Yomi:
No, it isn't!

26-2. A Thousand Emotions
Announcement:
Those graduating will now enter.
And now, a speech from our principal.

Principal:
To those of you who are graduating, congratulations.
To our guests, to our visiting and to the guardians of the students, we...

Osaka:
Achoo.

Principal:
We wish to extend our sincere gratitu...

Osaka:
Achoo.

Principal:
We wish to extend our sincere gratitude to you for coming today.

Student:
What was that?

Student:
No clue.

Principal:
Now, for those of you who are graduating...

Announcement:
Presentation of diploma.
Representing the graduating class, Masaaki Ohyama.

Tomo:
Hey, why is that that I'm not the one representing the graduating class?

Yomi:
You have to ask?
You sure your brain hasn't melted or something?

Tomo:
Why do I ask? Maybe because I'm the strongest?

Yomi:
Huh?

Tomo:
Ha!

Announcement:
And now, to the student who achieved the highest grades this academic year, we'll present the Kinran Award.

Yomi:
It isn't you. So, sit down.
I'm telling you. Sit down.

Announcement:
This year's Kinran Award goes to Miss Chiyo Mihama, a Year 3, Class 3!

Yomi:
Like I SAID, it isn't you!

Announcement:
Miss Chiyo Mihama, please come forward.

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, they're callin' you, Chiyo-chan.

Chiyo:
Huh?
Are they talking about me?

Principal:
Excellent work, Miss Chiyo Mihama.

Chiyo:
Yes, sir!

Tomo:
Bravo!
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

Student:
Should we stand?

Student:
Dunno.

Everyone:
â™ªã‚ãŠã’ã°ã¨ãŠã¨ã—(ã‚ˆãåˆ†ã‹ã‚‰ã‚“ã¨ã“ã‚ãŒå¤šã„ã®ã§ã€å¾Œå›žã—)

26-3. Sorrow
Tomo:
Hm?

Chiyo:
Mi... Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
I lost my wallet!

Chiyo:
What?

Yukari:
Oh, I don't care anymore.
Presenting the diplomas...

Tomo:
Hey, you're wrecking the mood!

Yukari:
Kagura.

Kagura:
Yes.

Yukari:
Osaka.

Osaka:
Yes.

Yukari:
Tomo.

Tomo:
Yeah.

Yukari:
Argh!
I don't need your cheap sympathy!

Tomo:
Hey, that's mean!

Yukari:
My 10,000 yen bill! My 10,000 yen bill!
I knew I had one in there!
Okay, time for final words.
Well, goodbye, everybody.

Tomo:
You're wrecking the mood!

Nyamo:
Um... hey, Miss Tanizaki.

Yukari:
What is it? Oh, Nyamo.

Nyamo:
Someone who found this picked it up and turned it in.
Isn't it yours, Yukari? This wallet.

Yukari:
Everyone, congratulations on graduating!

Nyamo:
I'm sorry, everyone.
Didn't mean to be late.

Students:
Thank you for everything, Miss Kurosawa!

Students:
We've been waiting for you!
Goodbye, Miss Kurosawa!
It was fun!

Nyamo:
Now, now, it's not over yet.
There might not be diplomas for everyone here, you know.

Students:
What?!

Kimura:
However, the three years that I have spent together with all of you in my class have been very rewarding and meaningful for me as well.
This wonderful time that we have shared will be ending as of today and...

Kaorin:
Mr. Kimura...

Kimura:
But!
Kaorin and I will be together forever!

Yukari:
And so, that's all I have to say.
Everyone, rise!
Bow!

Kagura:
Well, Miss Yukari, this is from everyone.

Yukari:
What a huge bouquet!

Kagura:
It's one flower from each of us.

Yukari:
They're wonderful.
I wonder whose will first wilt and die?!

Everyone:
Uh...

Chiyo:
Oh, Miss Yukari...

What did you do that for?!

Yukari:
I just had to.

Chiyo:
I guess... I guess high school really is over now, isn't it?

Yukari:
Well, yeah.

Chiyo:
We won't get to see each other every day anymore, will we?

Tomo:
Hey, wait!
Hey! Hey!

Osaka:
Ow! Ow!

Yukari:
Well, when all's said and done, that's all there is to it.
You guys should be just fine, but no guarantees.

Chiyo:
Huh?

26-4. Alma Mater
Tomo:
You ready?

Osaka:
Uh.

Tomo:
Okay, now let's do one more!

Kaorin:
Miss Sakaki... right!
Uh... Miss Sakaki, how about we take a picture together?!

Sakaki:
Mm.

Kaorin:
Tomo, take a picture of us too!

Tomo:
Sure! That'll be 1,000 yen.

Kaorin:
Uh...

Tomo:
No, I was just joking.

Is everybody ready?
There, got it!

Kaorin:
No, you don't! Got it! You tilted the camera down!

Tomo:
Okay, fine, whatever.

Kaorin:
Take it right!

Tomo:
Here goes.

Kaorin:
Send me that when you get it developed, okay?

Tomo:
Yeah, yeah.
Hey, Osaka!

Kaorin:
Are you listening to me?!
Please send it!
Postage due is fine.

Tomo:
O-Okay...

Yukari:
Hm? Hey, Kagura, what's wrong?

Kagura:
Miss Yukari.

Yukari:
What's up? You forget something?

Kagura:
Say, Miss Yukari,
I've been thinking, would it... be bad if I took a chair or desk home?

Yukari:
Yeah, it would be bad.

Kagura:
I was thinking of taking something back as a keepsake, but, oh well...

Yukari:
Hm? Well, don't worry, you're already taking something back with you.

Kagura:
Uh...

Yukari:
That's right. Your precious memories of everyone.

Kagura:
Oh... Thank you, Miss Yukari!

Yukari:
What? Okay?

Chiyo:
Then, for our graduation trip, why don't we all go to Magical Land.
Since Miss Yomi couldn't come last time.

Yomi:
O-Okay.

Tomo:
We'll do it before Yomi's school makes a posting.

Chiyo:
What?

Tomo:
'Cause it'd be a real downer if she doesn't make it in.

Yomi:
I am getting in! We'll do it after!

Tomo:
Yeah, you're right! You'll get in.
You've just gotta believe it.

Yomi:
Ah! You piss me off so much!

Osaka:
That's right, you know.
It'd be great if Yomi gets in too.

Yomi:
Huh?

Osaka:
Lemme see the charm that Chiyo-chan gave you for a sec.
You have it, right?

Yomi:
Yeah. Here.
Wh-What are you gonna do?

Osaka:
Yah!

Yomi:
Uh... What are you doing?

Osaka:
I'm puttin' my powers into it.

Yomi:
That's unnecessary!

Yukari:
Huh? What's the holdup? Hurry up and go home already.

Tomo:
Okay.

Sakaki:
All right then. Shall we go?

Chiyo:
Yes.

Yukari:
See ya. Be careful on your way home.

Tomo:
You, too, Yukari.

Yukari:
Sure thing!

Tomo:
Let's do another trip this summer!

Yukari:
Sure, if I feel like it.
See you guys around.

Chiyo:
Ah, Oh, right.

26-5. Everyone
Yomi:
Hm, 3661, huh?
Okay, but I can't really say whether this number is lucky or not.

Osaka:
Sure turned out to be a nice day.

Chiyo:
It certainly has.

Tomo:
Do you think this one's open today?

Kagura:
This looks like fun too.

Tomo:
Oh, yeah, what about that one?

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan, are you excited?

Chiyo:
Yes! Let's ride that big roller coaster we rode on last time!

Tomo:
All right!

Osaka:
Y'all are brave.

Yomi:
Hey!

Tomo:
Oh, Yomi, didn't know you were here.

Yomi:
So you were serious about going to Magical Land immediately after the announcement was made?!

Kagura:
We didn't have a choice.
This is the only time that worked for everyone.

Tomo:
Don't worry, we've already thought of what to say to comfort you.
Right?

Osaka:
Oh, yeah, did you make sure to bring that good luck charm?

Yomi:
Yeah.

Osaka:
Lemme see it for a sec.
I'll put my power into it one last time...

Yomi:
Chiyo-chan, please imbue this with the power that got even Tomo into college!

Chiyo:
Yes!

Tomo:
Yomi, I looked but I didn't see your number.

Yomi:
No!
She's still in the middle of imbuing it with her power!
You weren't supposed to...
You weren't supposed to look!

Huh? What's the...?
It's there.

It's there!
It's there, it's there!
It's there!
It's there! It's there! It's there!

Chiyo:
Congratulations! Miss Yomi!

Osaka:
Happy day!

Kagura:
Good job, Yomi!

Sakaki:
I knew it.

Yomi:
Thank you so much.
Thank you, everyone.

Tomo:
Yomi!
You did awesome!
Argh...

Kagura:
Let's hoist her!

Tomo:
Good idea!

Yomi:
Tha-That's okay.

Tomo:
Yeah!

Tomo:
No! Yomi's too heavy, so let's do Chiyo-chan!

Yomi, Chiyo:
What?!

Everyone:
Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!

Tomo:
Okay, who's ready to have some fun now?!

Chiyo:
Won't this be great, Miss Sakaki?

Sakaki:
Yeah.

Kagura:
We're gonna have fun today!

Tomo:
Off we go!

Osaka:
Hey, wait! How're we gettin' there?

Kagura:
We've gotta head to the train station first, right?
Hey, Sakaki, let's have a race to the station?

Sakaki:
No, I... uh...

Yomi:
I think I'm gonna ride a roller coaster first thing.

Tomo:
Oh? You'll probably pee your pants, Yomi.

Yomi:
I'll be fine.

Tomo:
Sure if you say so?

Kagura:
Hey, I heard they've built a brand-new ride.

Everyone:
Yeah.

Osaka:
Ain't it supposed to be scary though?

Tomo:
Woohoo!

Kagura:
All right, we're riding that one!

Tomo:
Is it really that scary?

Chiyo:
I see...
Even when we've graduated... we'll still be together.

Osaka:
Chiyo-chan!
Come on, Chiyo-chan! It's time to go.

Chiyo:
Okay!
